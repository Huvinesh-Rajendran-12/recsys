Period of tiredness for two hours or so after each dose. Very hard to wake up in the mornings.,Was prescribed as an alternative to Citalopram. Had virtually no effect on my depression whatsoever. In the period of winding down the Citalopram dose then the 7 weeks on Mirtazapine I went from mildly depressed / just about coping to suicidal; unable to cope and deeply depressed most of the time. Would advise anyone who gets rapidly worsening depression after a med change to see the doctor again far sooner than I did.

Epilim is used in treatment as a mood stabiliser( was told by a doctor).

Possible reduction in IBS symptoms.,Too tired to get up in morning; irritability; couldn't get drunk anymore as I would drink loads and nothing would happen.,Did little if anything for depression and anxiety. On 15mg things got worse and I got angry so easily but this went away on 30mg. I didn't put any weight on and I didn't feel very hungry on this drug and I thought that was supposed to happen.

Vivid dreams. No other side effects exceptr morning anxity ++. Food tasted better at first; but this faded in a week. To sleep was good; but morning psychedelic effect no good. I sincerely doubt that the mirt would have been manageable without adjunctive benzodiazapine therapy and i wonder if the overall treatment out come would not have been better with benzo monotherapy as i presented with anxiety and insomnia and the M caused anxiety. ,Morning anxiety ++,30mg daily oxazepam 30 prn x3 max

I was not sleeping due to severe anxiety and moderate depression. The drug has significantly improved anxiety symptoms and is gradually lifting mood and reducing depression symptoms,First week I experience fairly bad nausea; first month I was sluggish and tired and head felt "foggy" but persistence and going to a full dose resolved all of the problems. Only ongoing side effect is moderate lethargy.,15mg daily for first 2weeks; 30mg daily ongoing
patient,49,female,anxiety; depression; panic attacks,hypokalemia; panic disorder,Tranxene; K-Tabs,Remeron (Mirtazapine) ,Adrenergic-Alpha-Antagonists Histamine-H1-Antagonists Psychotherapeutic-Agents Tricyclic-Antidepressants,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,15mg  taken one half twice per day for the period of couple of years; still take it,Felt 'normal' rather than in a state of panic and anxiety. Thoughts were clearer and not racing. Felt calm and peaceful.,I was told patients can gain weight on it - i didn't. (apparently you eat more; that's where the extra weight comes from)....can make you tired; which for me is good; as i'm very hyperactive.,After trying many anti-depressants; anti-anxiety and panic drugs - sometimes alone; sometimes in combination; nothing really worked for years until i tried (and continue to use) Remeron. It has made a *world* of difference to me and my quality of life. Started out on 7.5 mg one per day - gradually increased it. Too much made me sleepy; but found a right balance. Wish i knew about the drug many many years ago.
patient,28,female,IBS/anxiety,nothing,triquilar,Remeron (Mirtazapine) ,Adrenergic-Alpha-Antagonists Histamine-H1-Antagonists Psychotherapeutic-Agents Tricyclic-Antidepressants,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,15mg  taken once/day for the period of 3years,I had mono which went undiagnosed and that; along with other life stressors had me very sick and run down. I was diagnosed with Irritable bowel syndrome and suffered from severe nausea. I was unable to sleep or eat and began to lose weight. I had tried many anti-nauseants to no avail and began remeron as a last resort. My nausea all but disappeared. I only became nauseated when working nights. My anxiety level also somewhat decreased.,I was very sleepy at first and would sleep up to 14 hours per day. I was also recovering from mono at the time; which may have contributed to my drowsiness. I felt a bit dazed at first as well.,I took 15mg once a day at bedtime as it causes drowsiness and it could be increased to 30 mg although I never needed an increase. I took remeron to get rid of my nausea which was constant and severe and it worked. After 3 years I had a major crisis in my life and forgot to take my remeron for 4 days in a row. When I finally did take it I was incredibly tired and couldn't keep my eyes open all day. I felt stoned and the only factor that had changed had been the remeron. I decided to try stopping as I had not suffered from that severe nausea since starting remeron. It has been 2 months and the nausea has not yet returned. I have no other side effects.
patient,47,female,depression,insomnia,none,Remeron (Mirtazapine) ,Adrenergic-Alpha-Antagonists Histamine-H1-Antagonists Psychotherapeutic-Agents Tricyclic-Antidepressants,6,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,30mg  taken 1/day for the period of 4 months,Boosted my mood a fair amount. My MD chose this med because I was having significant insomnia; and it definitely helped that; which was great.,But after I had caught up on my sleep; I felt very grogged out; even in the daytime. This was not acceptable; and I soon stopped the med.,Took before med to help with sleep and avoid daytime grogginess. But it still made me groggy during the day.
patient,22,male,Depression,Anxiety; chronic pain,Wellbutrin,Remeron (Mirtazapine) ,Adrenergic-Alpha-Antagonists Histamine-H1-Antagonists Psychotherapeutic-Agents Tricyclic-Antidepressants,2,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,15mg  taken x1/day for the period of 1 1/2 months,No apparent benefits.

If anyone is hyperactive this drug seemed to be sedating and gentle (if u can handle that).  ,realy have nothing bad to say about this drug; however if you are at a loss for energy to begin with; this drug will make it worse.,30 mg tab  1 x daily for 3 months
patient,29,male,Depression; insomnia; Rx induced insomnia,Anxiety; MPS; BPS,Lexapro,Remeron (Mirtazapine) ,Adrenergic-Alpha-Antagonists Histamine-H1-Antagonists Psychotherapeutic-Agents Tricyclic-Antidepressants,7,Considerably Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,7.5mg  taken once 1 hour before bed for the period of Only once so far; just started,rated a 7 due to the potential it has after one experience. Blue/green clouds are nothing to scoff at!,Hallucinations; waking up feeling as if in out to sea on a small sailboat and i am trying to walk below deck and its very rough waves outside. I was swaying pretty hard; then came the blue and green clouds; which i had to walk through; WHICH did not go away for hours; until i called in sick and took a nap. They should put a note on the Rx bottle "will(not just may) cause hallucinations". Although; i maintained; i do not know if i will try to stay on the medication - that was 2 nights ago.,is WAY too stimulating. I cant imagine it making me groggy really; it feels almost like cathinone stimulation. On the verge of euphoric; but not; and very jittery - so i was hoping the remeron would counteract that like the doc said. Another day on the weekend this time(blue and green keyboard made it really hard to work in the morning) ill attempt to start again; hopefully that was a strange occurrence(although; it was entertaining; but not ok for going to work!).
patient,60,male,Insomnia,Anxieties; bipolar; ,Clonazepam,Remeron (Mirtazapine) ,Adrenergic-Alpha-Antagonists Histamine-H1-Antagonists Psychotherapeutic-Agents Tricyclic-Antidepressants,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,15-45 mg  taken 1 dose bedtime for the period of 17 years,Remeron (mertazapine) was a god send for me. I had chronic insomnia with sleep deprivation for 12 years and tried to treat it with OTC drugs. It appeared one night; not slowly over time. I tried several meds without success before my doctor suggested Remeron. It took a few weeks to take effect but it has been 100% successful for about 17 years now. I used to take up to 45 mg. at bedtime but have ratcheted it down to 15 mg. over the years. If I miss one dose I know it. Falling asleep is no problem. My problem is staying asleep for more than 2 or 3 hours night after night after night. . . Not fun.,No side effects. No hangover. No morning drowsiness.,Take about 1/2 hour before bedtime. 
patient,29,female,Depression,None,None,Remeron (Mirtazapine) ,Adrenergic-Alpha-Antagonists Histamine-H1-Antagonists Psychotherapeutic-Agents Tricyclic-Antidepressants,3,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,Not sure? Half a Pill  taken before bed for the period of 1 week,Hardly any except I felt so physically tired that I couldn't even feel depressed.,I was so exhausted that I could hardly get out of bed and get to work. At work; I just wanted to put my head down and go to sleep. As soon as I got home around 6pm; I had to go to bed. It was ridiculous.,I just started treatment for severe depression. I sleep okay; but have nightmares all night; which is why my doctor recommended Remeron. I am going to ask for a change in this because even though it has only been a few days; I am barely functional.
patient,45,male,Greater Depression,Anxiety,Wellbutrin,Remeron (Mirtazapine) ,Adrenergic-Alpha-Antagonists Histamine-H1-Antagonists Psychotherapeutic-Agents Tricyclic-Antidepressants,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,30 Mg  taken one time a day before bed. for the period of Two weeks now.,Depression has cleared up quite miraculously.  ,Eating too much - no sense of when to stop. Slight antihistamine feel.,also wasn't able to work for the last two years because of moodiness and benzodiazpine use for anxiety and sleep.  Now I have cut out all thosoe medications and I really do feel much better.  Eating too much does seem to be an issue. I eat so much sometimes that I can't breate. That part is going to demand some serious self - control. 
patient,29,female,asthma,allergies,allegra-d,Advair HFA (Fluticasone / Salmeterol) ,Adrenergic-Beta-Agonists Anti-Allergic-Agents Anti-Inflammatory-Agents Bronchodilator-Agents Respiratory-Agents Sympathomimetics topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,7,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,1 puff twice a day  (dosage frequency: everyday)  for the period of 3 years,improved breathing; less frequent asthma attacks and the ability to run either outside or inside; depending on the season,no side effects really.  despite it all; i still had some difficulty depending on the season.  when cedar is really high; i still suffered asthma related problems even though i was taking the drug regularly.,advair is an inhaled power that you take twice a day.  it's composed of two "active ingredient" - a long acting bronchio dilator and a steroid - both aid in combating asthma.  
care giver,59,female,Asthma/Allergies,Gingevitis,None,Advair HFA (Fluticasone / Salmeterol) ,Adrenergic-Beta-Agonists Anti-Allergic-Agents Anti-Inflammatory-Agents Bronchodilator-Agents Respiratory-Agents Sympathomimetics topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,9,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,2 puffs/inhales daily (AM & PM)  (dosage frequency: 2 puffs/inhales daily (am & pm))  for the period of 1.5 years -- still taking it,Overall; the benefits have been very good.  A rescue inhaler hasn't been used in more than a year; nor has there been a severe asthma attack.  During the period there may have been three incidences where it seemed like an attack was coming on (curing exertion and cold; damp weather) but simply a better environment and a couple of cups of coffee warded it off.  There are times of wheezy; heavy-chestedness; but these are minimal in comparison to prior to taking Advair.,Wallet shock.  Patient seems to overall fall asleep easier; but tends to have some problems getting a deep sleep; but this may or may not be related to the Advair.  Other than that; there do not seem to be any adverse side effects  -- casually or medically -- after about 1-1/2 years of taking the medication.,The patient developed asthma four years ago.  It was controlled on an 'attack' basis; generally with an OTC inhaler.  When most OTC inhalers were taken off the market prior to reformulation; and a severe asthma attack; a prescription inhaler was prescribed; but it was being used more often than should; and did not alleviate the problems.  After a thorough examination; the doctor prescribed Advair; as directed with two puffs/inhales daily; morning and evening (at least 8 hours apart).  The patient is examined/tested every three months prior to refilling prescription to ensure there are no side-effects or adverse reactions.

Not sure whether my condition is a form of asthma; COPD; or what; but this medication has so far certainly made it much less bothersome.,No noticeable side effects so far.,I use one puff first thing in the morning when I take my other medications; and one puff at bedtime.  After using; you are instructed to rinse your mouth well.

My doctors found a plethora of 15 different bacteria; fungi and viruses in the lung; and associated the condition with either AIDS or cancer. Things that are usually prevented by the immune system;opportunistic infections were abundant and had spread; in spite of antibiotic and antifungal use; to a sytemic infection.  Nocardia siriacogeorgensis; MRSA; MAC; aspergillus; pseudomonas among others were all found.  the Nocardia in particualr had already caused a mild form of encephalitis.,Twice daily; one puff; every day.

This is the only drug I have taken that has completely changed the way my lifelong asthma was controlled. Relief was immediate and the severity of asthma attacks has considerably lessoned to a degree as opposed to other drugs which supposedly prevented the attack but when one did occur; were life threatening.,None to speak of so far.,Since I began taking Advair it has been a twice a day treatment that remains to this day.

Early morning breathing became easier instead of tight breathing.  My use of a rescue inhaler specifically; Proventil; was cut down from several times a night to usually 0. I only use my rescue inhaler occassionally now instead of routinely.  My life has changed with Advair; I highly recommend it!,When I first started it; I noticed a little bit of nervousness; this only lasted a few days; and with continued use; I am no longer having any side effects.  I have never experienced any of the lung infections the package insert speaks of; nor have I ever had sudden asthma symptoms after using the Advair Inhaler.,One inhalation of the Advair Inhaler in the morning and one again at bedtime.

I'm sure it has saved lives. With one inhalation I am able to breath again within minutes; this is even if I am having a bad attack; and am really strugling. So it is very effective,But; when I use albuterol I experience mild chest pains afterward. Not immediately; but typically later that day or the next. They don't last long; just a sharp pain or two; but it does occur fairly often. In my case; since I don't use albuterol regularly; it's well worth it.,Inhalation; pump spray

It did take at least seven days before I could breath properly all the time. I did finish all the medication as my dr. prescribed. ,I had dry mouth that no amount of liquid intake appeased and I had trouble sleeping but Im not sure that was the medication or the fact  that I had a problem breathing which could keep me up.,I was to take a pill in the morning and the evening. It did not matter if I ate food or not. however; I was feeling dry both in my body and in my mouth. I was not sleeping well.

I had heard that some people experience a caffeine-like high but the medication did not have this effect on me and I was able to take it before bed and able to get to sleep.,My GP instructed me to take it twice a day; two puffs until it ran out.

The behavior and memory problems remained unchanged or worsened over time.  Anxiety continued to increase and the dementia progressed systematically.  Disorientation continued to increase and the patient became more and more difficult to manage.  It appeared that irritability increased and the patient became more agitated more easily.,There was some indication that there was at least some increase nausa as well as some infrequent but increased bouts of diarrhea.  There were a few episodes of vomiting; but it might be attributed to other factors for this one side effect.  There was definitely increased insomnia as well as loss of appetite; but it can not be definitively stated that the drug alone contributed to these although it did occur after the drug was begun.,The patient was given a daily dose.  After transfer to a care facility; the regimentation in taking the dose was firmly set in place.  Staff medical personnel on site did not observe any benefits; and as a result; after about 6 months the prescription was terminated. During the time the drug was used; there was a patient review every other week to ascertain whether there seemed to be any improvement in the patient.  Memory tests were administered and one-on-one interviews were executed by medical personnel.  The results of the memory testing showed no net improvement nor was there any identifiable changes that might be considered positive.  Ultimately her psychiatrist in consultation with the family decided that the drug did not seem to provide any net gain.

This is uncomfortable during the first 2-3 weeks; then your body gradually gets used to it. ,I'm back on the 5mg of Aricept for the past 2 weeks and the plan is to stay on that dose for 6 months to a year.

I took it for several years and stopped last year after I gradually cut back on my dosage; exercise and yoga have helped me manage my symptoms so I no longer needed help to sleep at night.

You should take it only at beadtime; don't take it before driving a car. For me there are no side effects because of low dose probably. Ideal to balance your mood and improve your life quality.,Sleepiness on the following day,I started to have it after a nervous breakdown due to panic attacks.

I was a chronic insomniac; rarely sleeping more than 5 hours a night; often less.  With amitriptyline I was able to sleep more regularly (although not always); thereby alleviating some of the symptoms of depression and living more functionally on the whole.,Unfortunately; athough I was sleeping more regularly; I was still not rejuvenated.  The sleep was of a drugged quality; remarkably different from a natural sleep; in that I still felt tired a lot of the time.  Always dry mouth after the night; and after several years of use; I wondered if it had affected my memory; as loss of memory was notable. Seems to me that I had frequent headaches; as well. ,I took the drug every night; just before I intended to sleep.  Often I would fall asleep; but still wake in the night; although usually falling asleep again; which I would not be able to do without the drug.  Mornings were a little foggy for me; and there was the reality of dry-mouth; and the possibility of a headache.  I tried to quit for several months after the second year; but was so plagued by insomnia that I went back on it.  After another 9 months or so; I quit because I was worried that the long term use had affected my memory and the efficacy of the drug was inconsistent in any case.

I have fewer days off from work and can enjoy life with family and friends without worrying about headaches.,I experience an increase in headache severity after taking the medication as well as nausea and light sensitivity. But I only have to take 1 pill; tolerate the increase in symptoms for about 1/2 hour and my headache is gone. And; I don't have the headache hangover I used to have with other medications.,I take a daily medication at bedtime (amitriptyline) which reduces the frequency of my headaches (significantly!) and then I take Axert when I do get a migraine headache.

Doses of Immodium helped but dosages were becoming higher and daily and I still had uncomfortable bloating and cramps.  I started to lose weight and could not keep it on.  Doctor decided to try me on Elavil.  We started with 25mgs.  That helped; but I would still have trouble toward the end of twenty four hours.  We bumped it up to 50mgs.  This helped tremendously.  I now can eat normally and can eat most anything I want!  This drug changed the quality of my life.  An added benefit is that my insomnia is better since I started taking the medicine.,There was some sleepiness for about a week; but that faded as my body adjusted to the medicine.  A few very weird dreams for a little while; but these have faded too.,N/A

Although it is mainly used as an anti-depressant; in the tricyclic family; it causes considerable drowsiness at even a low dose of 50mg.  This immediately helped with my insomnia.  It also caused no daytime "hangover" effect and the dose can be increased easily.,The major side effect of drowsiness is desirable in my case; but it also has a marked side effect of weight gain.  In addition; there is a dry mouth effect that seems to resolve after a month or two.,This was prescribed by my psychiatrist after trying several newer hypnotics.  The newer medications such as Ambien and Lunestra caused sleep disturbances; particularly altered dreams states.  In the case of the latter; it is prohibitively expensive.

As the years went by; I had to keep increasing and was up to 100mg. I had VERY dry mouth; I got to where I couldn't talk because my throat was so dry. I had to have a bottle of water next to me ALL the time; and I chewed gum constantly. I had to take laxatives every 3 days. I was so sick of it; I went to my doctor to see what was wrong with me. She thought it might be the amitriptyline; so she told me to wean off of it and she gave me 30mg of Cymbalta to start. I went down to 50mg and already started to feel my mouth was not so dry. Not sure how the Cymbalta is going to work since I've only taken it 4 days now; but I'm hoping it works.,I started with 10mg.  I noticed a difference after just one week. It worked really GREAT. I was able to sleep with no problems at all. If I woke up for any reason; I'd just fall back to sleep right away.  It was a lifesaver to me. I wish I could still take it.

I used to be almost fully awake every time I experienced a hot flash (every 1 to 1.5 hours).  Now I get a few hours of fairly good sleep at the beginning of my sleep cycle.,There are no adverse side effects so far.  Some nights I don't sleep as deeply (as described above) during the first few hours of sleep.  I'm not sure what makes the difference from one night to the next-perhaps the amount of sleep I got in the few nights previous.,I take one tablet at bedtime.  I try to delay taking it until I'm just about ready to go to sleep; since the effect is most pronounced in the first few hours after taking the tablet.  Later in the sleep cycle; my hot flashes wake me up more fully; as they have for the last four years.

I believe I experience some slight lethargy that is ongoing; but not troublesome. When I first started taking Catapres I got a very dry mouth; but this quickly went away. I have experienced no other side effects that I am aware of. ,I'm not sure what this question means; and may have already answered it. I am taking Catapres and Betaloc for longstanding essential hypertension. I have noticed that when I take these two drugs together their individual effectiveness is amplified. I have been cautioned by my doctor that it is important not to suddenly stop taking this drug combination as this could cause a heart attack.

OA commonly affects the joints of the fingers; knees; hips; and spine. Other joints affected less frequently include the wrists; elbows; shoulders; and ankles. OA can also be caused by work-related repetitive injury and physical trauma. ,Arthritis causes inflammation of the joint lining; called the synovium. This type of arthritis can cause pain; stiffness; swelling; warmth; and redness. The affected joint may also lose its shape; resulting in loss of normal movement. RA can affect other parts of the body as well; including the blood; the lungs; and the heart. Rheumatoid Arthritis is 2 to 3 times more common in women than in men; and generally affects people between the ages of 20 and 50. However; young children can develop a form of RA called juvenile RA.

I chose to discontinue the treatment.,Some mild stomach irritation.  ,The knee pain became progressively more severe over the course of 2-3 months. My family doctor sent me to physical therapist who stress tested the knee; and the physical therapist determined that I should see the specialist.  A consultation with an orthopedic doctor was scheduled with an MRI performed.  The MRI showed some swelling in the knee joint ligaments under the front of the knee cap.  No tears or spurs were visible; thus the diagnosis was possible early stage of arthritis and/or minor injury.  I felt the arthritis was not completely impossible but more likely that some possible injury was probable owing to my daily work activity but no exact injury could be documented.  After the week of celebrex usage; without any noticable relief; I chose to discontinue the medication route in favor of some time off (2 weeks) with ice-pack heat-pad therapy to reduce swelling and pain. Next I self applied sparingly over time some physical therapy at the local gym; to strengthen any possible sprain-injury situation that may have occurred. To date my knees have been relatively trouble free when i adhere to age appropriate work and leisure pursuits (reducing strenuous projects as i get older). My construction business is slowest in late fall and winter; during which i continue my physical activity at a local gym.  Thus avoiding future injuries.

She was eventually diagonsed with large cell carcinoma of the lungs.  She had an exam before taking celebrix and was clear but after 2 years of taking it she had cancer. whilst in hospital she learnt that fellow patients also taking the same medication also developed large cell arcinoma of the lungs. Is it a coincidene i may ask?.I also remember she was short of breath.,she forgot to take her medication soon to realise that the pain was coming back.  So hence she realised she had forgotten to take it.   It clearly worked to relieve the pain of arthritis.

I also suffered mild depression because of the chronic pain.  Cymbalta began to relieve my symptoms almost immediately (and the depression as well.)  I still have pain;sometimes better;sometimes worse; but this drug in combination with others (see above) as well as consistent exercise has helped tremendously.  ,The gabapentin; which I was taking long before cymbalta; made me sleepy; but on the day after a night of disrupted sleep; the fatique can be overwhelming.  Also; for the first six months or so; I had a lot of gas and stomach rumblings.  When I first started on cymbalta; I felt very spacey and light-headed but that passed after a couple of weeks.  My internist thinks my blood pressure is up slightly because of the cymbalta,I take cymbalta in combination with 2800 mg gabapentin and 25 mg elavil.

However; I feel the Cymbalta is much more effective in keeping the dark cloud off my head; allowing me to be more positive toward life on a consistent basis.,Dry mouth.,I really notice when I miss just one dose; it takes 2 - 3 days to catch up; but then I become very aware of negative feelings and apathy.

Ongoing ,the past two years I was diagnosed with Shuermann's Kyphosis; a degenerative back disease in the lower spinal column. Throughout the past two years I have been on and off intensive narcotic pain killers; Ie. Vicodin ES;Percocet;MS Contin etc.. I knew enough was enough; so like that I stopped taking them. I have no side effects whatsoever. I have been through and still ongoing physical therapy ( 4th session 1 session is 3 weeks ) and been too four Orthopedic doctors and spinal specialists. My doctor and I discussed a long term pain application to get me off taking narcotics. I am no pro; but I know that opiates are the best for bad chronic pain; which i experience every day in my life. My doctor and I talked about Cymbalta which can be used to tone down the pain level sensors in the brain so I am not experiencing so much pain. I also have high levels of depression; and anxiety. Recently my Aunt and Uncle passed away which they practically raised me when I was born in Ireland; and my Sister's deaths was even more of a add on. I felt myself slipping into a deep black hole; and was looking for cheap thrills just to keep myself from going crazy ( literally ). Anyways; it has been my third day on this prescription; and I feel like a new person. I find myself enjoying simplistic things; and taking initiative in my life to pursue my goals and education. I am currently unemployed and as a young adult it is very hard to maintain money flow with no job. I am enrolled and taking college courses which I have 2 more semesters left before I receive my degree. In one of my classes (Chemistry) We are assigned a Science experiment. Mine; will be for depression and pain levels which will I am using Cymbalta. I recorded myself for two weeks; and then the first day after each dose of the drug. I am feeling alive; and that classical person everyone enjoys being around. I have read a lot about this drug and how it fails or makes situations worse. But for me it is working; and I am consistent in my daily routine. I shall continue to document all of my feelings and side effects from this prescription. ,I have no side effects at the moments. This drug is being used for a dual purpose action as stated in my recordings. I feel that this has a mixed review. For me I was given two weeks of trials; and then 10 refills. So my advice to any of you; is to ask your care giver for a sample of any drug you take before you make it a routine pill. It takes 3-6 weeks for a Human to become physically and mentally dependant. I am very pleased overall otherwise. ,1 pill (30mg) Per day; in the morning.

The doctor then titrated me off of it and it took three months after I stopped Cymbalta before my liver went back to normal.  Just be sure to have your liver enzymes checked regularly if you are on this drug.  ,I was on 90 mg daily; one dose of 60 mg and one dose of 30 mg.  It was prescribed to me for fibromyalgia and depression; however; I did not notice much improvement on this drug but I was not on it for a real long time either so it may just take longer to notice benefit but it definitely affected my liver.

The depression had gotten so sever that I was unable to function properly. It has made me feel like a 'real' person again. It has not done much for the anxiety; panic; or OCD. The Xanax helps with that area. I will be going to the psychiatrist in 2 weeks for the anxiety; panic; and OCD. Hoping to stay on the Cymbalta. I was on Lexapro 30mg from 2000-2006. Then switched to Celexa (cost reasons) 60mg from 2007-2008. The Celexa just about costed me my life. It was ineffective for the Depression.

My Dr. reccomended Cymbalta b/c it "weight neutral" and also has pain relieving properties. ,I haven't experienced any typical anti-depressant side effects with Cymbalta (dry mouth; nausea; heart racing; figgity). The only thing I have noticed is a few hrs after I take it I get really tired; and could use a nap. So; I'm going to try taking it later in the day so I don't crash in the middle of the day. ,Cymbalta was presribed for me to treat my chronic tension headaches and mild depresion.

It was interfering with work and sleep. In the past; I was treated with short term steroids that masked pain and allowed me to participate in physical therapy. Results were always minimal; but better than nothing. After trying one medication for fibromyalgia unsuccessfully; my doctor agreed to try me on Cymbalta. It took about a month; but the results have been terrific.

It seemed to slightly reduce the nerve pain; but not enough to warrant taking it long-term.  Other than that; I did not notice benefits specific to my fibromyalgia symptoms.  It did seem to neutralize my feelings however.  I could not experience deep sadness.  So; I can see how it would help with people suffering from depression.,I experienced drowsiness in the first 1-2 weeks which went away.  At night; I experienced dry mouth and dry eyes; usually beginning about 8pm through bedtime.  I am a bit more drowsy in the morning.  It takes a bit longer to wake up completely in the morning.,I took 20 mg. 1x per day (in the morning) for the first week; gradually working up to 60mg. 1x per day.

Didn't feel as drowsy. I suspect that I could tolerate this medication after the side effects subsided or decreased after a few weeks; but because I work I couldn't wait...I would have been jittery and yet like a zombie for work and that was not an option

I am still taking it.  It also relieved my back pain for about 6 months but that good effect has diminished.  While I still am not the happiest camper; I am able to function normally.  I was not able to function before the cymbalta.  When I first got on it; I had extreme fatigue for several days and some "electric jolts"  when I was lying down.  However; that side-effect has gone.  It also causes some constipation; which is something I've rarely experienced!  I eat a very high-fiber diet but even so I'm not my "normal" regular self.   I'm writing this because of all the negative things I've read online.  If I had read them before I started the cymbalta I would not have gone it.  I'm happy I did not read anything!  I now feel that these reviews are written by  people with miserable results; or people who are incredibly impatient and expect and instaneous cure are the folks writing most reviews.  , constipation.,I take 60 mg. once daily in the morning.

Compared to short-halflife anti-anxiety medications; no feeling of emotional dependency on a once-daily ongoing regimen.,Generally rarely experience side effects. Taken on an empty stomach; mild transient nausea; but this is quickly addressed with any light snack. Discontinuation syndrome (when I have run out of the medication; or once when discontinued for 2 days due to elective surgery) is quite unpleasant.,Prescribed to act synergistically with stimulants prescribed for ADHD: the stimulants tend to increase anxiety; which also increases the necessary therapeutic dose for the stimulants; so this very low dose of the multiple reuptake inhibitor effectively reduces the dosage needed of the stimulant for therapeutic effect. This combination enabled me to reduce my stimulant dosage by 50% and also decreased my anxiety very substantially--the effect was almost immediately remarked on by my partner as well as in my own subjective opinion.

I felt like any situation was controllable and I was much more effective at my daily tasks.  The panic attacks; chest pains; and severe worry were almost completely gone. An added benefit was that muscle pain that I always seemed to have was also gone. I rarely had to take any pain meds. It seemed like a miracle. ,At first I seemed a bit hot. I sweat more often. Then I began not being able to handle any stress at all. I began feeling like I needed other aids to help me deal with everyday stress and I have never needed anything before. Then my stomach began to act up. I began having constipation or diarrhea constantly. Never normal. I began throwing up and now my stomach does not digest food well at all. I also was unable to sleep; severe insomnia. I chose to take myself off the medication because the stomach issues have completely taken over my life and causing major disability. The side effect have intensified so much that I cannot function daily. Severe dizziness; nausea; vomiting; and my mind has been having lapses. Sometimes I cannot get out of bed. It has been over a week. ,60mg once a day. I took every morning.

I think that this treatment is helping me a lot: now I have a sharper mind; I feel more energetic and I can concentrate properly.,The most annoying side side is insomnia and tremor. I take deprax to induce sleep but even with it I woke up very early. You can get used to some side effects like dry mouth; vivid dreaming and weight loss but tremor; although not serious; is very noticeable. I experienced delayed ejaculation at the begining but not now.  ,The treatment consists of Cymbalta 60mg and Deprax 50 mg; but it has been changed many times. The most difficult has been to induce sleep for some hours without feeling too sleepy in the morning. I tried with Loramet and Diazepam but their effect last too much; it's impossible to concentrate. Deprax 100mg is the best I've taken to sleep. Now I'm taking just 50mg and I don't fall sleep so quick but it's fine; I have enough rest.

It was perscribed to me after I was in the hospital instead of Vicaden (spelling?); as Vicaden does not suite me well.  The medication began working after about 45 minutes of taking it and (for me) lasted over 6 hours.  ,Treatment side effects for me were nausea and feeling unclear or 'loopy'. I found that if I took more than one pill within six hours; I became very nauseated.  In addition; I would not have been able to function properly or drive a car comfortably because of the side effects with my clarity.   ,The treatment was for pain and was taken by myself for a situation that could not have been allieviated by medical attention.  I had an ovarian cyst rupture.  My doctor and the ER told me there was really nothing for them to do other than wait for it to be reabsorbed.  So; pain medication was my last resort.  I took a few of these pills over two days to help alleviate my extreme pain.

I threw up periodically for the subsequent 12 hours; until it was completely out of my system.,Propoxyphene was prescribed with some hesitance by my surgeon; because I am allergic/sensitive to codeine products; and throw up with it as well. The follow-up call from the pre-op nurse advised me to discontinue (which I had already done) and try Tylenol instead. I had been able to tolerate Darvocet 14 years ago after a c-section. I am petite; at 5'4" and 104 lbs.

Several medications tried such as ibruprofin; allieve; demoral etc caused many unpleasent and intolerable side effects. The Darvocet taken 1/2 tablet 4-6 times daily works perfectly as nearly can be expected. I also do not experience any bothersome toxicity or effectiveness problems as I generally would afford myself time-out days allowing my system a break from routines. I believe without this medication life would be greatly less enjoyable and my abilities to participate in a positive manner would be extremely limited.

After my two weeks were up on taking it; I gradually just didn't need it any more.,During treatment I would get very weepy and depressed any time I was awake.  Of course I slept for hours after I would take it.  Other than those two things there were no side effects.,I had surgery for endometriosis that left me in the hospital for over a week.  The doctor had to cut my stomach totally across the bottom to rid my body of the diseased tissue.  I'd been on morphine in the hospital; then came home taking the Darvocet for the next two weeks.

I also had a strained muscle in lower back area which I also experienced relief from.  The bursitis had been bothering me for quite some time (8mths)and mainly at nighttime when I was lying down in bed.  I found it difficult to get comfortable and often used a hot water bottle to soothe it.,Just after taking the pill (with food) I felt a bit dopey in the head which lasted for up to an hour; and sometimes a slight nausea (but not often).,Take with a large glass of water (i must say I did not notice this instruction until now).  Take 1 tablet daily (with food) when required to relieve pain and inflammation. Swallow whole.  Do not crush or chew.

I still had to take the maximum dose of ibuprofen to reduce the pain. I hoped taking Voltaren as well would extend the analgesic effects of the ibuprofen but it was fairly ineffective. ,None,75 mg Voltaren & 2.4g ibuprofen a day during periods of extreme pain

Though tiredness was on of the side effects of the problem this could not be resolved with drugs; though blood tests did show whether the situation was improving or not.,None were experienced at the time. there are side affects; but as i didn't really take the drug unless i couldn't cope this did not really seem to affect me. I tried to deal with the pain so that i could monitor if i was beginning to feel better or not.,Gentle exercise was encouraged to keep the circulation going. Keeping the erythema affected are rested; by keeping it resting up when sitting down or lying down with a cushion to aid. When swelling occurred anti-inflammatory medication and pain killers were useful in giving some relief.

I wasn't sure what was causing it at the time- ie. back strain or period pain or?? but the Voltaren made me able to walk and sit comfortably again ,nausea- I forgot to eat enough before taking the dose; and by the time I though tof it the nausea had settled in. It took a couple of hours to wear off.,I self diagnosed and took what seemed to be the approriate minimum dose; aware that it wouldn't be good to take long term.

I was taking fairly large doses of Oxycotin and switched to Voltaren 75mg.  They will not touch my pain.  I guess I have a high tolerance for pain meds.  I don't believe they would be effective for people with chronic moderate to severe pain.  ,Upset stomach.  ,I was perscribed 75mgs X 2 per day.  I take double that amount and still have very little relief.

I had considerable pain with shooting pains to my groin which caused my leg to almost give way.  I took Voltaren orally as instructed on the packet and it worked within a very short time and after one week the pain is very slight just a twinge now & then in my groin which reminds me that I need to rest!

It has worked on other joints too (hands; hips; etc..),dry skin; numbness at application site; strong smell; the smell disappears quickly; and I treat the dryness with moisturizer. The numbness goes away or is less noticeable with time.,I applied the gel as directed on box label.

(dosage frequency: 3 days)  for the period of 5 days,The Fentanyl patch helped some with pain; however; the patient was still in considerable pain.,On the 4th day on the medication the patient who had been very responsive and alert was groggy; not alert and fell several times in attempts to go to the bathroom; something he had no problem with proir to the medication.  In attempting to assist the patient; it was evident that his heart was beating rapidly and he was in a cold sweat.  He died on the 5th day on the medication.  ,The patient was suffering from cancer of the esophagus; which was in an advanced state at the time of diagnosis.  The patient was to begin treatment for cancer the day following his death.  He had received a feeding tube through his stomach and was sent home from the hospital with a perscription for Fentanyl patches for pain.  He had previously been taking a much milder medication.  The patient rapidly deteriorated and died within 6 days of receiving the feeding tube and within 5 days of beginning the Fentanyl patch for pain.

I also received relief from lower back pain and as such allowed for better sleep to occur. There is also comfort in knowing that as my illness progresses and as I age that relief is out there for me when and if I choose to use it again.,Soemtimes the skin where the patch was placed became sore; itchy; red and inflamed. However; the most problematic side effect was during the transition phase between each 30 day prescription. For example; if the pharmacy did not have the product; I would have to go without a patch for a day or two I would experience withdrawal symptoms; jitteriness; crawling skin; sleeplessness with dizziness. The whole ordeal of getting in to see the doctor every 28 days; getting the prescription;; well; it all was getting so stessful I just went cold turkey and quit using them. Which; by the way; was pretty foolish because I had a difficult three days by myself to say the least.,I was having considerable hip and shoulder pain.  Also; I had significant sciatic pain but the sciatica pain was not as chronic as the shoulder pain.  While using the fentanyl patch I was given facet block injections and as a result have had little problem with the sciatica.  The fentanyl patch also relieved tingling pins and nnedle like pain in my feet that I had in the mornings when I first woke up and put even a little of my weight down on my feet.  For me the patches served me for the time that I was using them.  I am however; glad that for now I do not currently use them.

Even though I am very opioid-tolerant; it was still sedating for me.  In addition to causing drowsiness and fatigue; it tends to be highly habit-forming.  Because of the strength and nature of the drug; the human body becomes physically dependent on it; which has a few implications.  First; it loses efficacy over time; meaning you need to keep increasing the dosage over time to maintain the same effectiveness. The other issue with physical dependence is withdrawal.  I had severe physical withdrawal symptoms if I waited too long to change the patch (starting a day or so after I was scheduled to change it and becoming more and more severe with time.)  Several specialists I saw actually recommended hospitalization for controlled dose reduction as the safest way to stop taking fentanyl patches because they cause such severe physical withdrawal symptoms.  I withdrew from it completely 3 times; and suffered severe; debilitating symptoms for the first couple of weeks each time with decreasingly severe symptoms lasting for over a month after I stopped using it.  Although I have never had an issue with psychological dependence on any drug; I think it is important to mention that this one can be very addictive (meaning that those who take it frequently develop a psychological dependence; especially if the user is prone to substance abuse.)   ,It is a very strong opioid; which is highly sedating; especially in combination with other drugs that can cause drowsiness.

This anti depressant wasn't a miracle drug but I think it did help make things easier to handle and; in general; neutralized most life experiences.,I don't recall any severe side effects other than occasional tinnitus. The more severe side effects became apparent after I began attempting to discontinue use of the medication. At that time; although I withdrew from the dosage in very small amounts over a long period; the tinnitus was quite pronounced; especially after any sudden head movements.  I often felt dizzy for no reason.,I'm not sure exactly what information you are requesting here but treatment started with a relatively low dose; escalating to a higher one.  This was done in reverse when I decided to stop taking Effexor.  In retrospect; I'm not sure how much it helped me but had I known how difficult it would be to stop taking the medication; I probably would have asked my doctor for an alternative.

I have taken every antidepressant in the book. I received some benefit from most of them but my depression always returned and many of them had unpleasant side effects; including weight gain and constipation. This drug helped me enjoy life again. I still have occasional bouts of depression due to life cirsumstances but they are much briefer and less severe. I feel much more outgoing and enjoy being around people more. I no longer want to withdraw from the world and now face the world with much more confidence. For people worried that this drug produces an "artificial" feeling of happiness--this is not the case. This is the way people are supposed to feel. you will still have a normal range of moods. I only wish this drug had existed sooner--my whole life would have been differnt.

patient,37,female,depression,fatigue,provigil,Effexor (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,75 mg  taken 1/day for the period of 3 months,I did not experience the "brain-fog" that I did with Celexa. I felt great after the first couple of days - relieved the depression immensely. ,I was one of the few who experienced severe constipation from taking Effexor. Thankfully; this side-effect abated after two weeks. I've also noticed that just one of my eyes appears to have decreased in visual accuity - from 20/20 to maybe 20/30-40. ,After using Celexa for 7 years; it decreased in its helpfulness. Celexa always made me feel like I was in a fog as well - hated the stuff. Immediately after taking Effexor; I felt the fog lift and I can't begin to tell you how relieved I am;  or how greatly that improveed the quality of my life. I still have moments where I feel a little anxious; but as a whole; the depression is being taken care of. When I noticed a decrease in visual accuity in my right eye; I stopped taking the drug. My eyesight seemed to return to normal. Oddly; my left eye is fine; but it was always extraordinarily good. 
patient,36,female,Depression,Mitral Valve Prolapse,None,Effexor (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,4,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,37.5mg  taken once per day for the period of 3 months,While taking Effexor at the 37.5mg dose; I have noticed some improvement in my mood stability throughout the morning.  I felt less anxious during the day; but anxiety creeps in again towards the night.  Although I felt MUCH happier and more like my "old" self on the higher dose; the 37.5mg dose allowed me to sleep the night; which was not possible at the higher dose.  ,Upset stomach was common if I forgot to take it with food.,My doctor prescribed due to depression and anxiety.  As mentioned above; I felt so much better on the higher dose (75mg?)... but was unable to sleep at night for several weeks on this dose.  Therefore; I began again at the lower (37.5mg) dose (after trying a few other antidrepressants).  Overall; I am currently unhappy with the effects of the lower dose.
patient,30,female,depression,none,none,Effexor (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,6,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,300umg  taken everyday for the period of 1year,depression reduced - I had taken it at a lower dosage at first - but his had no effect - at all - so psychiatrist had to prescribe a higher dosage than the family doctors are allowed...the effect was amazing - I suddenly felt a 100% better after  a week or so - I had been on the lower dosage for months with no effect.,I felt nauseous. Gradually I became acclimatised the effects- so after the initial boost I felt normal again - like I could engage with life. After a while (6-months) I felt like I was experiencing a distance because of the drugs; instead of feeling engaged in life like I had felt initially; I felt like I was veiled from it.  ,I was prescribed increasing doses by my family doctor until he had reached the maximum (150) he could prescribe. I tried to commit suicide; I was referred to a psychiatrist who doubled the dose. After seeing the psychiatrist twice over 2 months. I did not have to see her again. And my family doctor could continue to prescribe at this higher dose.
patient,39,female,Depression/Anxiety,PTSD,Xanax,Effexor (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,4,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,75mg  taken once daily for the period of one year,Overall mood was enhanced for a few months; then benefits plateaued and disappeared.,Loss of sex drive; Increasing agitation; Heart palpitations making heart murmur much more apparent; Worsening nightmares and night sweats.,Doctor hoped to wean me off of Xanax by using Effexor as what she called a "non-addictive" substitute. Unfortunately; I needed increasing doses of Xanax to counteract some of the side effects of the Effexor. Stopping Effexor resulted in about a week of zero energy and flu-like symptoms; and several weeks of mental confusion and what felt like "brain zaps".
patient,35,female,depression,anxiety,provigil,Effexor (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,150mg  taken 1 x daily for the period of off and on for 6 years,The benefits of taking Effexor are wonderful. My mood has been so much better. I can function properly without feeling overwhelmed and or stressed out. I have recommended this drug to many of my friends who have had similar problems.,The side effects are mild; but excessive sweating is one of them. I seem to sweat a good bit more than I normally did as well as sweat more than other people that I notice. Also night sweats have been a problem from time to time. Constipation can also be a side effect. ,The details in the treatment are just as I described shortly above. I went to the doctor; they prescribed it and I take it. Don't really know what else to say here for the treatment details.
patient,45,female,depression,anxitety; occasional agorophobia; trichotillomania,Luvox,Effexor (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,300 mg.   taken once daily for the period of 9 years,The effexor worked the first day I took it.  For some time previously; I had felt "paralyzed;" or too depressed to get much done.  The day I began taking it; I noticed a difference in that I felt more able to get out of the house; and able to cope with the difficulties of mothering 6 children full-time. As I said; it worked the first day; but continued to work better and better over the next 3 weeks until I worked up to my eventual dose (I started at 37 mg. and worked my way up to 300 mg.).,The only side effect I noticed was that if; for some reason; I forgot to take the effexor in the morning; by the evening I felt sort of dizzy in a really weird way.,not sure if I was supposed to tell about more than one medication for this survey. However; these four meds I've mentioned were all sort of intertwined; so it seemed appropriate for me to do so. I have taken a myriad of other anti-depressants in my quest to find one that would work; and I would be willing to share my experiences with those other meds as well. Just let me know if you want mori info.
patient,41,female,depression,anxiety; sleep distrubances,gabapentin; modifinil,Effexor (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,1,Marginally Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,375 mg  taken 2x\day for the period of 3 years,the presumed benefits were to help with a severe depression. in the beginning there was some benefit; ie less suicidal; apathetic; morbid; depressed. but the effects were short lived and dose had to be continually increased. the biggest benefit was probably placebo - feeling like i was getting help; hopeful and trusting in the treatment and doctors.,here we go.the initial effect would be dry mouth and sleepiness; not being able to think straight or function really but once the dose would be acclimatised it would be okay. but it also cased both hypo and hypersomnia. shakiness at times. large cognitive deficits in reading and comprehension (eyes would literally\ physically play tricks not seeing words or substituting others; blind spots)and a general confusion not knowing what i was doing where i was going.nightmares; nightsweats,family doctor initially prescribed wellbutin but a psychologist at the hospital suggested effexor. the dose would be increased as i would adjust and experience setbacks. the gabapentin was added when i had sleep troubles and to augment. many things were also added and subtracted to no avail. a psychiatrist felt the dose could be increased to 375 mg. so it was but i was not under any supervised care other than my family physician. all the above side effects caused me to be sent from specialist to specialist who all had tentative diagnoses ranging from borderline personality; narcolepsy (the modifinil); sleep apnea and restless leg; and finally bi polar. finally a different psychiatrist said it was the drugs!
patient,55,female,depression,none,none,Effexor (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,9,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,75 mg  taken 1-2 daily for the period of 2 months,it was after I stopped taking the medication that this "cure" took place; but I never experienced this with other anti-depressants. While taking it; Effexor made me so sleepy all the time that I slept a good deal more than normal (10-12 hours daily). This is why I stopped taking it. But when I did; I felt better than I had in years. I remained depression-free for about 3 years. I then dealt with depression again for about 8-10 months (I didn't want to lose another 6-8 weeks taking the Effexor "cure" so I delayed; hoping I would just "snap out of it" on my own). When I finally conceded this wasn't going to happen; I returned to my doctor; who then convinced me to try something new; so I tried Cymbalta; hoping to get Effexor's benefits; without the side-effects. It worked well as long as I used it; but when I stopped; there was no "cure" like I'd had with Effexor. Now I take 600-1000 mg of samE. It's not as good as the post-Effexor experience; but I feel less dependant on the medical system for my maintenance; and I focus on physical health (good food; exercise; vitamins)to maintain my emotional health. Those things alone; unfortunately; do not completely do it for me; and that's where the samE comes in. It makes the difference.  ,As indicated in the question relating to treatment benefits; the side effects of Effexor; for me; were a tendency to sleep a lot; and to feel sleepy much of the time.,I began Effexor under the care of a psychiatrist who was treating me for depression. My depression took the form of a lack of interest in all aspects of my life and I had begun to "shut down" to such a degree that sometimes the act of just walking from the garage into my house required a strong act of will. When I had to run errands; like grocery shopping; I felt an uncomfortable detachment from my environment. My treatment with Effexor; at worst; sometimes simply took me down (energy-wise) an additional notch from where I was. At best; it shifted me from the uncomfortable detached feeling and elevated my mood a couple of notches above where it had been. I had moments of feeling fully functional. That was enough to give me a sense of feeling better; and the will to decide to take my full energy back. That's when I stopped taking it; and experienced the miraculous "cure". If I ever experience such a deep depression again; I will choose to try the Effexor again (the original; not the newer version); rather than the Cymbalta. With the Cymbalta; I would already know that the benefits would only last as long as I chose to be on it; whereas; the Effexor would give me hope for a lengthy remission.

I began to think more positive and objective.  I also began to sleep much better; to much for quite a while.  After a couple weeks; I was not nearly as depressed and it kept getting better.  ,Some constipation; little to no sex drive,I was prescribed Effexor XR for depression.  I initially began on a low dose to make sure I could tolerate it.  The first day; I noticed a decrease in anxiety as it made me a bit tired.  After a few days; I could tell I was thinking more clearly and did not have that 'doomed' feeling as severe.  I began doing more things and getting involved which helped even more.  After a couple weeks; my Dr. doubled the mg. and that is the current level I am now on.  I feel very good and only have set backs when things in my life are extremely stressful.

Also; after approximately 2 months of treatment; the medication does not seem to be helping as much as in the beginning; as I am starting to wake up several times throughout the night again.  ,Will only take for 6 months as I have heard that Effexor is highly addictive & causes severe withdrawal symptoms.

I felt worse while on this drug than before I started taking it.,I felt like I had consumed 12;000 cups of coffee. I was anxious; nervous; jittery and irritable. I could not sit still.,I was supposed to start at this dose and then go up to a higher dose after a few weeks. I completely took myself off of this drug since it was not helping me and there was no way I was going to increase my dosage. My doctor never even followed up with me after prescribing this medication...tsk; tsk!!

I would have to really control my emotions which seemed off the charts!  Also; I found my heart would race and I would feel very speedy.,I was prescribed to take one 20 mg dose two times a day.  This seemed like to much at times; and so I would cut it in half.

I am more patient and less agressive. I was really irritable with a constatly ''under pressure'' feeling before. Now i feel a bit less concentrate maybe but way more relax. ,The problem for me if my strange dreams. Plus; my sexuality is not that good anymore because i can not have orgasum!

Provided a "floor" to my mood and I never go below that.  Prior to Effexor (and before that; Prozac) I had frequent periods of suicidality.  I still often get very depressed but am much more functional and my behavior has stabilized.,The inability to drink more than 2 glasses of wine at a time!,Effexor was first prescribed by psychiatrist and then by psychopharmacologist.  I see the psychopharmacologist every 3 months for 1/2 hour to evaluate the efficacy of meds.

I thought it might be hormaonal; but after taking away the drug ; the symptoms alleviated.,I now feel that I have suffered fibromyalgia for a long time; and part of the reason I was depressd was I found it hard to deal with the pain i was feeling at the time; I had two very young children ; and was not diagnosed with a condition . If I had understood my condition better; I may have managed the fibromyalgia better. I was pushing my body too hard; as I felt frustrated t not managing everything better; and the cycle of depression continued. I have come off the venlafaxine; and the symptoms of pain; particularly in the morning have returned; but I can manage them better; knowing it is not symptomatic of a seriously damaging condition; and that it is 'normal' for me. I pace myself better; and no longer have the demands of very young children ; so can do that easier. I like being 'drug' free; although I do supplement with fish oils and 5 HTP

Though starting at 37.5 mg; the psychiatrist quadrupled the dosages within one month's time to attempt to make a dent on my emotional condition.,As the dosage increased; the lack of effect turned into a complete removal of affect as well as a persistent feeling of listlessness and heaviness (like having weights on limbs and chest). ,Though starting at 37.5 mg; the psychiatrist quadrupled the dosages within one month's time to attempt to make a dent on my emotional condition. The month was ended abruptly due to hospitalization for attempted suicide by overdose. I was not weened off of the medication. The doctor was then brought before a committee for misconduct in prescribing Effexor to a minor as well as disregarding warning signs of a suicidal youth. This was the worst month in regards to my depression and anxiety; and was a definite reversal in any progress that was accomplished with a different doctor on a different medication.

I was having uncontrollable emotions of sadness; crying and even thoughts of suicide.  Taking the effexor helped me not only control my emotions but also diminished the intensity as well. ,Initally when I started taking Effoxor it upset my stomach. I was taking in the morning after breakfast so the Dr. suggested taking it before bedtime which solved that problem.  I have been taking it for sometime now and do not remember any other side effects from this mediation.,I started off taking 50mg for two weeks then increased the dosage to 75mg for two weeks.  After visiting the Dr. after a month on this dosage he recommended going up to 100mg and eventually I increased it to 150mg.  This is currently the dosage I am taking.

I'm actually an MD; and was prescribed this drug for anxiety and panic attacks. I know to give a drug about a month to work; but I lasted all of 3 days on this!! Started with a 75 mg dose; immediately fell asleep for 4 hours; woke up feeling so out of it that I could barely string a sentence together; spent the next day feeling nauseous; hot; sweaty; jittery and weak. Got leg spasms that night and woke up 12 hours post-ingestion having a rebound panic attack. When morning finally arrived; I had the kind of hangover headache that you get when you're in college and have spent the night parting and binge drinking; but without any of the fun. The next day; upon advice from my psychiatrist; I dropped the dose right down to 25 mg; with no change in side effects. 3rd day I tried only 6.25 mg (quarter of a 25 mg pill); and still felt nauseous; hot; dizzy and weak...and fell asleep for two hours. This is now day 6 and I'm finally recovering from my 3 day trip to hell with Effexor. Left a 5 min message on my psychiatrist's machine - will not be taking this crap anymore!! Will not EVER be prescribing this to any of my patients.,75 mg per day starting dose for anxiety and panic attacks.

I finally knew what it was like to be "normal".,I did not experience side effects,I had taken other anti-depressants with no benefit and negative side effects.  I also had done various talk therapies.  When the dose of Effexor XR got high enough; I felt for the first time what it was like to be "normal" - happy; sad; etc. without the overbearing feeling of depression.  When I had to go off the Effexor XR due to cost; the depression recurred.  This drug literally changed my life.  However; when I talk to other people who were not helped by it; they frequently are on a very low dose.  I am glad that I found a doctor willing to prescribe a high enough dose to be beneficial.

It appeared to stabalise the situation without comprimising the patients ability to perform normal work functions.,There was some drowsiness after taking the capsule; and therefore it was taken at night.,One capsule per day; taken in the evening.

My mood improved dramatically; I felt happy and engaged in life again.  It also worked fairly quickly.  I began feeling the effects within the first week.,The side effects I experienced while taking Effexor were insomnia; rapid heartbeat and grinding my teeth at night.  Also; I found myself incessantly jiggling my leg while sitting at my desk; watching tv; etc..  All in all; these were minor and as easy trade-off.  The major side effect I noticed was a complete loss of libido and inability to reach orgasm.  Simply put; it was as if a switch had been turned off on my sex drive.  This side effect was the reason I chose to stop taking Effexor.,My physician started me out on 37.5mg/day for 1 week then increased the dosage to 75mg/day for another week and; finally; to 150mg/day.  After taking 150mg/day for about a week; I felt it was too much...my heart was always racing; I couldn't sleep; and I generally just felt "nervous".  My physician dropped my dosage back to 75mg/day and that seemed to work best for me.  I absolutely feel that the Effexor helped lift my depression.  However; I eventually chose to stop taking it because of the sexual side effects.  After being on Effexor for about a year; I both wanted and needed to have a healthy sexual relationship with my husband again.  I dropped the dosage back to 37.5mg/day for a week; then one every other day for about another week before stopping altogether.  I don't recall having any "withdrawal" symptoms.  Within a few days of the last dose; all sexual functions were back.

No relief was experienced in any way.  If anything; symptoms continue to worsen.,No side effects were experienced in any way with the original dosage of 37.5 mg.  Dosage was increased to a level double the original prescription and at this level the anticipated side effects became apparent.  Both drowsiness and dizziness were experienced at the increased dosage.  There was still no significant improvement in the original symptoms.,This was a very short lived "trial" to assess the efficacy of this particular drug for the presenting complaint associated with onset of menopause.  One capsule was taken each night in an attempt to alleviate the disruption to sleeping patterns caused by recurring night sweats.  After a two week period and no relief; the dosage was doubled.  The ensuing side effects of drowsiness; fatigue and occasional dizziness were attributed to the medication. Still no relief of the original presenting symptoms. The value of continuing with this medication was nil; so was discontinued.

Dealing with lifes regular ups and downs all became stressful if I didnt have it.  Had to stop taking it as soon as I noticed my behavior., I want to say it was 50 mg. doses taken up to 3 times a day.  It was somewhat up to me when I needed to take it.  Mostly for anxiety attacks.

If I miss a dose before bed I wake up with my clothes and hair soaked in sweat. ,tried to (without my doctors advice or knowledge) get off the medicine cold turkey when I lost my insurance. Doing that made me extremely emotional. I would start crying for no reason at all and felt crazy! I went back to the doctor and talked about my situation. She set up a program to slowly take me off the medicine. I stepped down my dose by 75mg every 2 weeks till I got to 75mg. Then I went to taking 37.5 for 2 weeks. Then went to 37.5 every other day for a week. Then 37.5 every third day and so on till I finally got down to none. I went 6 months off the medication before going back to the doctor to be put back on it. I have now been back on it for about a year now. I have no plans to ever stop taking it again.

I am currently taking 300 mg per day. Before going on Effexor XR I was a crazy person...I tried to commit suicide several times. I still had anger issues and was given Lamictal and my anger has decreased immensely. I had been on so many different antidepressants I thought this was how my life was always going to be; my family slowly watching me sleep myself to death. Since my doctor put me on Effexor XR added Lamictal & Desyrel I feel better than ever. I also found out I'm allergic to wheat; dairy & eggs. Deleting these items from my diet along with the medications has made me a new person. ,The only adverse effect I experienced was when I tried to play doctor and wean myself from the meds. It was like withdrawals from hard drugs; chills; nausea; etc. I took periodically myself off my meds because I didn't want to be dependant on medicaton. It was always the wrong thing to do.,My Dr gave me a sample pack (containing 7-37.5 mg capsules & 7-75mg capsules) as well as a  prescription for 75 mg. I was to take the 37.5 mg capsules then the 75 mg capsules. The dosage has been increased over time to 300mg.

Having weaned off those; it was hard just to get out of bed - I was missing work and couldn't hold it together at all.  Within a couple of days of taking this I started to feel better.  It's been the best so far at managing my depression but I still needed other drugs to help with mood swings and anxiety.  Overall a good payoff; just wish it was generic!
patient,40,male,Anxiety; mild depression,none,none,Effexor XR (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,75 mg;37 mg  taken daily for the period of 1 year,Venlafaxine is a bicyclic antidepressant; and is usually categorized as a serotonin-norepinephrine reuptake inhibitor (SNRI); but it has been referred to as a serotonin-norepinephrine-dopamine reuptake inhibitor. It works by blocking the transporter "reuptake" proteins for key neurotransmitters affecting mood; thereby leaving more active neurotransmitters in the synapse. The neurotransmitters affected are serotonin (5-hydroxytryptamine) and norepinephrine (noradrenaline). Additionally; in high doses it weakly inhibits the reuptake of dopamine; with recent evidence showing that the norepinephrine transporter also transports some dopamine as well; implying that SNRIs may also increase dopamine transmission. This is because SNRIs work by inhibiting reuptake; i.e. preventing the serotonin and norepinephrine transporters from taking their respective neurotransmitters back to their storage vesicles for later use. If the norepinephrine transporter normally recycles some dopamine too; then SNRIs will also enhance dopaminergic transmission. Therefore; the antidepressant effects associated with increasing norepinephrine levels may also be partly or largely due to the concurrent increase in dopamine (particularly in the prefrontal cortex).,Difficulty in reaching orgasm. Increased amount of ejaculate. Rare mild headache.,My uptake levels were not severely out of balance. I started with 150 mg and felt the positive effects in 20 minutes. I was told it would take a week. I reduced the dosage to 75 mg then 37.5 mg after six months because I felt those doses to be too strong. I know others that found this drug helpful. Others it had no effect on at all; even at doses of 300 mg.

After a while it had been less effective; and my doctor cycled me rapidly through other drugs that did not work well. I had been inpatient for a week because treatment had been going so poorly. So this drug seemed better; compared to that; for a while; but gradually I noticed that I didn't so much feel better as that I just didn't feel anything at all.

I have found it tremendously difficult to maintain or loose weight.  The weight problem seems to have increased over the years to a point where I would like to try and stop or at least decrease the medication.

I have seen problems when I miss a dosage so I am scared to try and stop the medicine.  Before I when I "weaned" off the medication I had severe headaches; nausea; and dizziness. I am worried about trying to quit again but I  am having such problems with trying to loose weight that I want to try.

Very effective in lifting severe depression and reduced frequency of panick attacks (though did not eliminate them entirely) ,Some insomnia; very vivid dreams; sweating at night. DO NOT MISS DOSES OR STOP TAKING...discontinuation happens really quickly and is the harshest I've ever felt (I've come off of Lexapro; amitriptyline and nortriptyline) Also my heartrate has increased slightly. ,Went up to 300mg a day from the starters pack within a few months of starting it.  Lifted a very deep depression; at the time it was a godsend. After a year of being on it at 300mg it is starting to lose effectiveness (which I am told is typical) so I will either have to switch or add something because I can't increase much more.
patient,21,female,depression; social anxiety disorder,panic attacks,lorazapam; reclipsen(birth control),Effexor XR (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,37.5mg; 75mg; 105mg; 75mg  taken once a day morning or night. for the period of 2.5 years and currently,After a few months of treatment; I was actually able to function and get my social anxiety under control. My emotions became intact; and I enjoyed doing things again. ,Missing a dose of this medication is HORRIBLE. I start feeling withdrawal symptoms after 24 hours of not taking my medication. I once went 3 days without the 75mg pills; and I thought I was going to die. I was in a constant spin; I cried the whole time; I was exhausted; but I couldn't lay still. I was so nauseous that I couldn't eat and dry heaved for days. I literally thought I was going to die. DO NOT MISS A DOSE OF THIS MEDICATION!! In the beginning of treatment; I started out with 37.5mg pills and I did feel nauseous and dizzy for the first few days until my body adjusted; but it was nothing compared to how I would be feeling in 2 weeks! I do think this medication completely killed my sex drive. I don't have the urge to be intimate at all. ,I must say; I got extremely lucky with this medication. It was the first one I tried; and the only one I had to try. I was 19 when I starting taking this medication and was just starting my first year of college. I lived in an apartment with my boyfriend and attended school; no job. But that's all I did. Never made it out of the apartment; never went out; I lived in a huge city; made no friends; just an absolute mess. My emotions were a wreck and I felt absolutely helpless. I cried alll the time and I started having panic attacks out of nowhere; which I had absolutely NO idea what was going on. I just dealt with them in horror. I drank and did drugs; but it only made things worse. My doctor prescribed this drug and it did absolute wonders; within a week; I was starting to feel the weight being lifted off my shoulders. Within 3 weeks; I was able to drive in traffic; and open my blinds to let the sun in. Within 2 months; I was back to normal! I have the occasional off days; but who doesn't? The thought of possibly being dependent on this medication scares me because of how hard it's said to be weaned off of it; but I'm too scared to even TRY coming off effexor because of the withdrawal symptoms I experienced before. Overall; this medication is amazing; and does wonders.

I had headaches and dizziness for weeks. Also caused digestive problems - bloating and flatulence.

Also craved sugary and carbohydrate rich food which ended up giving me thrush and other fungal infections. Caused concentration problems. I stuggled to concentrate on my work for a full day.

Better overall sense of well being. I was not as emotional and life felt more managable. I didnt even notice its effects while on it. I have tried other antidepressants that made me feel disconnected and my mind was cloudy; also experienced weight gain. Effexor did not make me feel like I was on anything; it just worked in the background. I only noticed it effects once I quit; my emotions were stronger and all my senses seemed intensified. ,Bad withdrawels upon quiting medication. Sexual side effects; My senses seemed dulled. ,Took 75 mgs once daily for about three months; then wheened myself of it. Very difficult to do; had withdrawels that included nausua; crying; dizzyness; brain felt like it was short circuiting in a way. I had to lay in bed when I didnt take it for 2 days.

Super bad side effects while going off the drug.  Google searched it.  Lots of people with the same symptoms.  read up before you start it.,took medication for 5 to 6 years.  Very hard to get off this drug.  I liked the way my anxiety was controlled; but it also inhibits all emotional response (at least in my case).  I didn't have any mood; emotion; nothing.  It gave me a very flat affect.  Also my doctor did not seem very informed toward drug side effects and withdrawl symptomologies.

Had tried Zoloft after my previous pregnancy; which seemed to stop working. Cycled through a number of other drugs (8 within 9 months) and ended up sticking with EffexorXR as it seemed the one with the least side-effects initially.,to taper off & managed to only go from 225 to 150mg for a week before MAJOR side effects kicked in: headaches; brain 'zaps'; aggression; agitation; extreme mood swings and hives. Returned to 225mg (for a month now) and still experiencing severe hives & developing allergies to a number of things I wasn't allergic to before.,Post-natal depression & major depression/anxiety.

After being placed on Effexor; I noticed an immediate change; however because I have been on this dose for a long time; I feel that the effects are wearing off.  I have not yet discussed this with my doctor.

My skin became extremely dry. I have no more natural vaginal secretions. My hair became very dry and I am experiencing small bald patch sin the front hair line.my sleeping pattern is absolutely awful.

My appetite returned and my sleep patterns normalized.   ,The drug made me nauseated the first month I took it. The only other significant ongoing side effect I experienced was constipation.,I began taking Effexor XR when I was severely depressed. I took it once a day for approximately five years.  My symptoms included crying; lack of interest in life; inability to concentrate; loss of appetite; and sleeping more than usuual. I could barely get out of bed and I could not function.

I have only had one increase in dosage from 75mg to 150 mg,Myoclonic jerks;paricularly when i am relaxed. I get these more often at night whilst in bed . Dry mouth .Sweating ;especially at night . Initially an occasional tachycardia . The worst side effect is withdrawal symptoms ;even if I miss one dose. These are 'headiness' like flu;nausea ;a really odd feeling . It goes after taking my normal dose within about 3 to 4 hours,I was clinically depressed about 8 years ago ;under alot of work based stress and looking after a young famiy;Eventually saw my GP who prescribed Venlafaxine &%mg which worked well.

I had palpitations; nausea; uncontrolable shaking; severe headache and felt strangely detatched from the world (it was as if I was watching the world through a dense fog).,This was my Psychiatrist and GP`s last hope of treating my depression with medication; and I was told that I probably would suffer no adverse effects ("very rare"; apparently). However; after telling them at my appointment a month after starting Effexor XR; I was told that dissociative symptoms of PTSD are rarely made worse by effexor.
patient,25,male,depression; axiety,none,Lyrica (prescribed off-lable for anxiety),Effexor XR (Venlafaxine) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antidepressants Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,2,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,75mg  taken daily for the period of 7-8 months before tapering off,Having taken a four other drugs for depression over the last 15 years (all of the SSRI category) or so; and I can say without doubt that this drug was amazing as removing my depression; as well as substantially reducing remaining anxiety left over.,It almost immediately raised my diastolic and systolic blood pressure my 20 and 35 points respectively (up to about 105/170); as well as elevating my heart rate from 75 beats per minute to 95-100 beats. I occasionally experienced difficulty reaching orgasm in the course of sexual activity; but did not experience reduced sex drive or difficulty attaining a full erection (I'm honestly not sure whether to rate this as a side effect or a benefit). ,The benefits of Effexor XR were terrific. The side effects while taking it were just fine with me; though my psychiatrist seemed alarmed about my heart rate and blood pressure. That said; the withdrawal was so atrociously horrible it simply wasn't worth taking. I would have rather taken a drug that was half as effective without this uniquely gross withdrawal. Let me put this into perspective: I've gone through nicotine; alcohol; and speed withdrawal (the last a long time ago) and the Effexor was the worst (and I required hospitalization for the alcohol). It took me between three and four months to taper off the drug. I tried to stop --unsuccessfully--at 75% the regular dose; then 50%; and then 25% before deciding to just taper it down to a dose so small I had a hard time believing it had any psychoactive effects at all. Even finally quitting taking the drug at all when I'd tapered down to 1/15th the initial dose; I experienced mild versions of the same awful withdrawal issues that had popped up before: intermittent (intense!) nausea (previously full blown vomiting on previous quitting attempts); night sweats; what I've read in Effexor forums described-inadequately-as "brain shivers;" though-- amusingly enough-- very little of the depression or anxiety rebound past the first few days of 0 mg. If I were at suicidal or bed-ridden level of depression this drug would be completely worth it; even with the withdrawal. Otherwise; I'm staying away from SSNRI's for a long time.

I noticed considerable change after using for 3-4 weeks. I am much more tolerant of things being "out of control" and have stopped some of my "patterns". ,I have occasional night sweats; very vivid dreams and almost no sexual desire. ,I had taken this drug several years ago for depression. I weaned myself off gradually after using for about 1 and 1/2 years. I have been in counceling for the past 5 months and was diagnosed with OCPD. The constant perfectionism created so much anxiety for me. I felt "stuck". After trying Celexa for several months I thought I would give the Effexor another try. I am very glad I did. The only down side is the cost. The drug is very expensive.

When I was being "weaned" off it; I had a lot of dizzy spells,I was put on a 37.5 mg dose once daily for about a month before it was increased to 75 mg. While I was using this prescription; I had regular meetings with the psychiatrist who prescribed it to track my progress and I attended therapy sessions once a week.

(If I didn't catch it at the onset; the capsule generally had no effect).  I would then lie down in a quiet; dark room.  The pill would typically reduce the headache within 30-45 minutes.  Occasionally I would end up feeling sluggish afterwards - not sure if this was a result of the medication or the headache.  Regardless; it has worked well to reduce headache pain.

No OTC drug comes anywhere near reducing the pain like this prescription does.  What I used to do for headache pain is lay down in a darkened room with an ice pack on my forehead.  If I could fall asleep usually the pain would be gone when I woke up.  Problem is that it is not always possible to find a quiet; darkened room when a headache comes on.  This prescription relieves pain completely within 45 minutes.,addition; I am worried about getting hooked on it.  I find now that I am taking these pills more often.  Also; I notice that now I cannot tolerate headache pain without these pills... same pain as before only now I just can't handle it at all.,I have (what I think is) sinus-related headache pain.  Pain is always in the forehead on the right side.  Changes in barometric pressure always bring a headache on.  Sometimes the pain is so bad I vomit.  I had sinus surgery (drilled holes in sinus cavities in forehead... sorry I don't know the medical terminology).  This relieved the headache problem for about 5 years; but it is  back again.  I think I would rather have another surgery than continue to take these pills.

I was drawn to this tablets because they look appealing; the red capsules are easy to take and the caplets are coated in sugar. Normally I'd take paracetamol; which are dry and hard to swallow; I choose these to be kind to myself !!!  I had no idea they could cause this reaction. they were good pain killers.  ,asthmatic condition.  Heavy chest; dry cough; weakness; cumulative effect over days.  Still prone to shortness of breath and tightness and heavy chest feelings; very sensitive to sulphides in wine and vinegars etc; was not before this. I only became aware of this connection when I took some I had left for  a period pain; once again within seconds I was really ill.,Not sure what this section requires ? It's a straight forward case of pain relief in response to the flu virus.  the symptoms and the side effects became inter-twined; so it was not apparent that this drug was causing a reaction and worse than that I continued taking it as I became more and more ill.  This is an over the counter drug; I would have appreciated more information from my pharmacist.  I have tried to tell as many people as possible about what happened. After I have stopped taking the treatment I am left with a susceptibility to asthmatic type symptoms; it was also scary as I instinctively knew I was getting worse and became concerned something very serious was going on. I have never experience that type of "illness" before; normally I take time out and get well... this was an eye-opener.

It lowered the amount of time it took to heal the ankle and also provided lasting relief from discomfort caused by swelling and pain. Swelling was substantially lowered after a week period and steps were taken to allow the ankle to regain flexibility due to subsiding of pain.,There were no treatment side effects except for occasional nausea or drowsiness. Drowsiness however helped the patient sleep faster and thus avoid discomfort of laying in bed with a sprained ankle. Overall it simply lowered the amount of time it took to heal the ankle and also provided lasting relief from discomfort caused by swelling and pain.,Three two-hundred milligram tablets of Ibuprofen were taken for two weeks daily. The sprained-ankle caused substantial pain; discomfort and swelling. In order to begin the healing process and rehabilitation of the ankle's flexibility; Ibuprofen was taken. Ibuprofen allowed the lessening of swelling and also resulted in a subsiding of pain and thus a faster healing process. Side-effects were low and insignificant though there might be effects if taken in the long term.

I attribute my being able to function on just one a day to my taking of many supplements; i.e. fish oils; MSM; Vit C; E and so forth.  I also do Tai Chi and try to stay as active as I can.

Three times daily dosage is also quite convenient. I have been taking this medication for over 10 years and I don't see any long term side effects associated with it. Another benefit is that the medication is very useful in preventing menstrual cramp. If it is taken BEFORE menstruation; I won't experience any cramp at all.,Side effects are I occasionally experience heartburn and nausea after taking the medication if I do not take it with food. Also another downside of this medication is that if i take it when the cramping has started long and severe; it is less effective and it takes a lot longer for the medication to be effective; no matter how much i take.,Overall I'm very satisfied with the medication in it's efficacy and side effects profile. I only experience occasional side effects and in general the medication is very effective in treating and preventing menstrual cramping. However; the medication is best being taken before the cramping has started or immediately when the cramping starts because the longer you wait; the less effective the medication is; regardless the dose of the medication.

At times when the pain was already established prior to taking the medication the pain was less effective - sometimes mildly and at other times not at all effective. Ibuprofen in this dose was the medication that best took away the headache pain over any other medication. If it did not work I might try an over-the-counter acetominophin (sp) product.  These were sometimes effective for mild headaches but for the severe headaches if ibuprofen didi not work; generally nothing did.     ,There did not seem to be any side effects of the ibuprofen. I almost always tried to make sure and eat something or drink milk when taking the medication as indicated to take with food.  I didn't experience any problems even when taking the maximum dosage suggested; 3 within a 24 hour period. ,I get severe headaches about every two or three months that can last for three to four days.  Sometimes the most sever headaches seem to be what I call a combination headache; wherein I may be experiencing the routine headache associated with premenstrual cycle but may also be effected by sinus or seasonal weather/ pressure changes or tension headache.  It seems the hardest to treat is the combination of the premenstrual headache with the sinus headache.  I often took both ibuprofen and an over the counter sinus headache medication with some effectiveness.  There have been a few times when nothing took the headache away all day and I may even vomit just from the pain. Some severe headaches were accompanied by sensitivity to light; noise or even smells.

I lost the desire to spend money in a ridiculous fashion.,Unfortunately I developed the much feared rash; and had to discontinue. I had recently started Cymbalta; so I can't be sure it was the Lamictal that set me off; but the psychiatrist didn't want to risk it. I did have to change the timing of the dose to bedtime; as it made me a bit tired shortly after I took it. Also; I believe it affected my vision; which got a bit blurry sometimes.,I spent years shuttling between SSRI's; which I know know were the key element in tipping me into mania several times. After the psychiatrist determined the problem was BiPolar 2; the first treatment she considered was Lamictal. I did get some headaches at first; and unfortunately; at some point the effects were negated by the addition of Adderal. Once the Adderal was stopped; it was all good again. I would recommend this drug to anyone; with the proviso that if the SJS rash shows up; you must stop it immediately. Despite that; I really feel it is worth trying.

However the 200 mg.did quit working after about year and a half; and I was hospitalized with a mixed episode. My Lamictal was raised to 400 mg. 200 at night and 200 in the AM. I am told this is the highest theraputic level for this drug for treating bi-polar. I am much more even but am also still on Geodon and kolonpin once a day. I am weaning off of zoloft-am at 50 mg. once a day at moment. I feel the real med that has helped is the Lamictal; I hope to wean off the rest of meds after being stable for a length of time. ,I do not think I have or had any side affects. It is hard to tell because I am on more than one drug; and while in the hospital I was on others. I am also alcholic so like that Lamictal is not habit forming. I am afraid I will put on weight as others have reported.,Diagnosed with Bi-polar 2 WITH MIXED EPISODES AND RAPID CYCLING. Had been perscribed many SSRI'S; due to depression but never fully treated for bi-polar because I felt like I deserved and did not want to give up the few highs I had when not depressed. I also did not believe I was bi-polar when dignosed 12 years ago as an in-patient; because I had no understanding of mixed episodes and rapid cycling. I thought when I was hypo-manic; it was just a great relief and celebration of not being depressed. I was also not honest about my alcohol abuse until about 6 months ago; and have since stopped drinking; which allowed me to realize I was quelling the manis with alcohol; and with out it I was more unstable and manic. My only fear now is that without an anti-depressant I will suffer depression again.

A general sense of being able to handle my negative emotions without falling apart.

Both therapists thought my symptoms indicated Bipolar II and I should try a different approach. I stared on a very low dose; as indicated; so the benefits took a while to notice.

Considering that I had previously taken seven different medications in failed attempts to treat depression; this was an appropriate choice.,I have noticed no side effects.,I take 100 MG of Lamictal orally; twice a day.

It has been entirely weight-neutral; which was a big consideration for me. I had some very pleasant side effects when I first started taking the drug--vivid but enjoyable dreams and an increase in sexuality. The only negative effects were sometimes having to reach to find the word I was trying to use (which has since lessened; although it still happens occasionally) and pretty bad acne (which I am now treating separately and is much better.) Neither of those effects are on the PI sheet; and my doctor seems very skeptical that either was caused by the drug; but I've found lots of anecdotal evidence of other people experiencing similar things. Regardless; the effects have been minimal and WELL worth it considering how much I've been helped.,have recently had a rather intense relapse into bulimia; but I doubt that's related to the lamotrigine either way.

I found that the closer I take it to bedtime the more frequent and more intense my dreams.,I began treating my bipolar disorder; I used to write a fair amount of fiction. It sort of flowed from me. I definitely had the artist's temperament. After Lamictal; though; that inherent creativity fizzled out. It doesn't come spilling out of me while I'm deep into a manic euphoria.

It almost has completly controlled my depression which was very severe; and has almost completly controled my mania. I still get slightly hypomanic; but this has not been a problem for me.,I originally took Lamictal 200mg once a day for two months in March 2008 and had to stop because of moderate memory loss(mild long term loss and  moderate/severe short term loss); loss of ballence; and fatigue.I was sometimes in a mental fog. I would repeat the same things several times an hour and not remeber that I had said it. When I first started taking Lamictal I was leaving for college in a few months and my doctor(whom I no longer see)rushed me to raise my perscription very quickly.During that time it had completly controled my depression and mania. ,I am currently taking it; and started taking it again in September 2009. I now take 150mg once a day. I have not had any side effects since I started taking it again in september.I partially believe that the reason it is so effective now is that I am 20 lbs heavier than I was when I first took Lamictal and because I now take a lower dose.

You have to be very careful with the dosage and slowly increase it; but it is completely worth it.,For the first night or two taking the medication and after increasing the doasage I had trouble sleeping.,Lamictal saved my life. I suffered from severe chronic body pain for 3 years; and naturally I searched for a physical cause but was never able to be diagnosed or treated correctly. Finally I was diagnosed with depression and began taking Lamictal. I felt a 180 degree difference in my life immediately. I started initially with 50 mg and slowly titrated up to 200 mg. Now I can sleep at night; I am not fatigued during the day; I can complete tasks and have motvation; and most importantly; I am completely pain free. The number 1 cause of body pain in teenagers is depression; and many doctors fail to take that into account.

It seemed to me though; after time; that my body got immune to the medication and I seemed to be back to the manic stages again.  I have been on tons of anti-depression medications that are prescribed for depression and bipolar disorder and it seems to my doctors/psychiatrists that my body just gets immune to them. ,fatigue and memory loss,I really wish this was the medication that finally worked for me; but unless some miracle happens; it's back to the drawing board.  I seem to still have my mania episodes everyday; sometimes it gets bothersome.  I seem to yell still; I have my days where all I want to do is stay in my room and not move.

After going off Lithium my Dr. took me off Ativan which set in major anxiety.  I started drinking to ease the anxiety; but the alcohol sent me into major Manic/Depressive moods.  While drinking I was extremely manic; and while sober I went into major depressive states.  I could barely leave my house while in a depressive anxious state.  I missed a lot of work and started working from home.  Getting out of bed seemed impossible; finally got on Lamictal which took about six weeks to fully kick in.  Since then my anxiety has gone down(lower than ever before).  I am on a low dose of Klonopin that is taken on an "as needed basis."  My life is has improved greatly since I have been on Lamictal; works much better than the Lithium ever did.  I am so greatful for this drug it has given me my life back.,None,Started out on 25mg/day and slowly worked my way up to 200/mg 2x's a day.  Saw a therapist once a week for about 8 weeks; then switched down to once every other week for a month.  Now my family Dr. is handling my prescription.  I am lucky about that because I was told that some Dr's do not feel comfortable handling bipolar drugs.

Nothing has ever effectively controlled my depression but Lamictal seems to have stabilized my condition at a tolerable level. I am more mentally "resilient".....I don't stay down too long; I'm able to bounce back quickly from a depressive state. I'm also taking Mirtazapine (30mg; 2 a day). Maybe it's the combination that helps. I was recently taking Pristiq and Mirtazapine and was terribly depressed. I quit taking the Pristiq and began Lamictal and had and a very quick improvement. ,Lamictal seems to have increased my sex drive. I'm constantly "horny" and masturbate alot. The crazy thing is that Lamictal also seems to cause anorgasmia.....difficulty in achieving orgasm. Most of the time I get 99.9% of the way towards feeling like I'm going to climax but don't. So this med has increased my sex drive but doesn't let me fully enjoy the "benefits". Anyone have any suggestions in dealing with anorgasmia?,I take one 150MG tablet each morning.

With just the two antidepressants I could still feel down and unmotivated; lethargic; hopeless at times.  But the lamictal prevented me from going down.  I have been diagnosed with dysthymia among other things and I have been told that there might be some sort of cycling akin to what manic-depressives have but of course not to that extreme.  The doctor was concerned initially about my diagnosis - the thought was that the diagnosis I had received (dysthimia) may have been wrong and really I was a manic-depressive (which I am not).  Apparently this is a mistake that can be made quite a bit.  This is what I thought was implied.  Boy have I been glad that someone came up with lamical.,There were no side effects.  If there were;(which I don't think there were) then they were so minimal as to go unnoticable by me. Some people say they are the type that has all the side effects.

I fought suicide constantly; read self help books; went to therapy; etc. I took this pill and noticed suicide never ever crossed my mind. In fact; I felt normal for the first time in my life. I was diagnosed with kidney cancer shortly after and a biopsy from hell that has made me almost homebound and terribly disabled. Yet; I don't have depression. I have every other emotion. I definitely learned quick that sadness is NOT depression. ,Unfortunately the last month; I feel very nervous. Now; it hurts me to focus on anything visually. I can't describe it but it's like the nerves in my brain. I hear this sound in my head like a car idle with an ocean wave. If I breath very deep less than a minute it goes away. Since they destroyed my lungs in that biopsy; I don't know if it is nerves or oxygen causing that. I know the vision and nervousness is nerves most definitely. I think I may be developing side effects from Lamictal. ,I'm not for sure about the side effects. I sure hate the thought of life without  Lamictal!I am really suspecting it; though.

Even when I had an appetite I still wouldn't eat much; which helped me greatly; since Epilim gave me terrible cravings.,just don't know what to do; because I just can't carry on like this.  It has affected my cycling; my running; my swimming; but he clearly doesn't give a damn.,I was on Epilim for a few months; but went over to Epitec (Lamictal) because Epilim made me very tired and depressed.

I quit using it and would only take it when I get so deep in pain I need to get a handle on it; the drug helps then,I was given Loritab to help stop the pain in my back and running down my left leg. I was to take it every 6 hours or as needed; which ended up using it round the clock the pain was so bad. The Doctors also gave me 600mg of Ibuprophin to take with the Loritab.

Before the lortab i did try the flexeril first and it didn't help; then I tried it with the Lyrica that only dulled the pain a little. Then the lortab and it helped tremendously. I started on two times a day after a month went to three and it helped to the point where i could work and I could get out of bed and do things like cut the grass or hiking and just many of other things. My overall experience were tremendous with minimal side effects!!!!!,The Side effects I experienced were minimal such as dizzyness; or lightheaded but addding a little food before my dose would most of time cure the side effects. ,I was diagnosed with a disc problem that was pinching my nerves in low back. My Sciatica was being pinched by the disc causing my leg to hurt really bad and numbness and tingling were involved. I started taking flexeril first and it by itself wasn't helping. Then i was put on lyrica 2 times daily with the flexerill and it dulled the pain but not much. After that i really didn't want nothing that strong but the pain was severe so the doc put me on lortab 2 times daily to start with and 3 times daily the next month and that helped tremendously. I did physicall therapy for about three months. and now i have minimal back pain and i can function like a normall 20 year old.

With either dosage; I experienced vibrant dreams/nightmares and/or an elated/lightheaded feeling while awake. Constipation relieved with extra fiber. ,In my experience with this medication; I've found it moderately addicting and should be taken with caution. I advise to take when in mild-moderate pain because that's what it's for; but hold off taking it every six hours (or as prescribed) if pain is not an issue. 
patient,17,male,Oral Surgery,n/a,Ibuprofen; Amoxicillin,Lortab (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,2/500mg  taken every four hours for the period of Two - Three months,As having surgery; my mounth experienced excruiating pain. I was without them for 3 hours. These seemed like the worst day of my life. After taking the pills I noticed one of two things occured. One; the pain was gone soon after taking them. Two; I became extremely tired. First I thought that it was only like this because I just had surgery; but no. It seemed as though everytime I taken a pill I needed a nap soon after. Don't get me wrong; I would rather have a nap and be painless then to be awake throughout the entire day and experience that pain. This stayed this way for the entire time that I was on Lortab.,Major drowsiness. Every time a took the pills; it made me extremely sleepy. This made me unable to drive; do heavy activies; or even hold a conversation. Also; if I taken the pill when I have had nothing to eat for a while; it seem to make me sick for a short period of time; roughly 30 mintues up to a hour and a half. I never became dizzy or anything else.,The pill did wonders for the pain. When I took them I recieved results within 10-20mins. They also lasted a moderate amount of time to deal with the pain as well. They do become somewhat "addicting". So I tried to take 1000 - 1200mg of Ibuprofen to compensate for the Lortab. However; when your in a lot of pain; Ibuprofen just doesnt to seem to deliever the results that Lortab could provide.
patient,37,female,pain,neck pain; arm pain; hands numbness,Diazapam,Lortab (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,10 mg  taken one to two tablets every eight hours for the period of still taking it,Had surgery on my neck; the lortab reduce the pain.The lortab help relieve th pain upto eight hours so I did not need to take as many pills to find release. This is a good thing because I do not like pills.  This medication helped tremedously.,a little nausea. This medication has a high risk of addiction. When you take it be very careful that you do not misuse. The lortab reduces the pain on the first pill however as you take the medication it seems to take more pills as you go along to recieve the same releif as first. ,take one to two tablets by mouth every 8 hours as needed for pain.

I had swelling of my hands and face; lethargy; drugged feeling but when I ran out of it over a weekend and had to go 3 days without it I experienced severe withdrawal symptoms; itching; skin crawling; insomnia; etc so I quit taking it,100 mg. 3 X day for about 3 months for fibromyalgia

However due to the length of diagnostic time required and the progressiveness of the problem; Cymbalta (in a.m.) and Lyrica (in p.m.) work well together.  The neuropathy does not both me at night; once I am laying down and settled.,Some dizziness; balance; and memory issues.  Some days are fine; others are disconcerting but livable.,Lots of testing at the Mayo Clinc (unmedicated) and then medicated with Lyrica; eventualy Cymbalta was added and works quite well about 60% of the time.  Prolonged walking or standing; driving over an hour;the wearing or shoes with backs; and socks exacerbate the neuropathy.  Some lower leg and foot therapy and massage also assists for short periods by releasing endorfins(?).
patient,43,female,Fibromyalgia,None,None,Lyrica (Pregabalin) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants,1,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,150 mg   taken 2 times a day for the period of 3 months,There was a minimum amount of pain reduction.  I believe the medication works neurologically and you do not realize you still have pain.  The side effects were so severe I was afraid to drive the car.  My memory and thought process was deeply distrubed and I still felt pain. My thought process changed so quickly during a mid sentence I sounded as if I was on drugs.  The side effects were just not worth tolerating for the small benefit.  I could not help but think with the way this is making me feel mentally what is the effect it is really having on me.  This medication was meant for Diabetics that suffer nerve pain.  I feel sorry for someone who would need to remain on this medication if it was helping reduce the pain.  As all medications it is not going to correct the underlying problem just address the symptoms associated with the problem.  I would not recommend anyone take it.,Irrational thinking; disrupted thought process; Slow reactions while operating a vehicle,Prescribe to me by my DO as the newest drug for Fibromyalgia she did not know how the drug worked but wanted to me to try it to see if it reduced my muscle pain.  I took myself off the drug because the side effects were to severe and they did not lesson over time.

Could not drive at all while on this med.  Also had extreme ankle and feet swelling and couldn't even wear shoes.,See above
patient,34,female,NEUROPATHY / ANKLOSING SPONDYLYTIS,SHINGLES,RELAFEN,Lyrica (Pregabalin) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,300 MG /DAY  taken 2x day for the period of ONGOING,Lyrica reduced the pain associated with my anklosing spondylytis when other therapies had failed.  I had tingling; numbness; pain; and very limited movement in my arms and legs from A.S. after developing 6 moderate sized bone spurs on my cervical spine.  It was severely limiting my ability to have any sort of life.  I have tried almost every form of pain killer from OTC to narcotics with very limited effects.  Lyrica works differently and I find that I can be RELATIVELY pain free.  It does not totally eliminate the pain but what it does is make it bearable so that I can function.  I could take more of it according to my doctor but I am more comfortable taking the lowest possible dose.  I've noticed that I have no more tingling; very little numbness; and a greatly expanded range of motion without pain.  I highly recommend this drug!,The treatment side effects are somewhat severe.  The first dose I took almost immediately knocked me out!  I was so out of it; loopy; sleepy; etc. that all I could do is sit around and then go to sleep! It didn't get better after a couple of doses and I originally stopped taking it.  My doctor helped me build up a tolerance by stepping up the dosage over a week or so.  That limited the side effects but I still find that if I miss a dose by even a couple of hours; I start going through withdrawal and start feeling AWFUL!  I don't feel better until I get the dose!  That is somewhat scary to me and keeps me from trying a higher dose but the benefits of having a "normal" life outweigh the side effects and I dont' know of any safer options to do that.,Treatment details?  I guess you are asking for how often; etc.?  I am on ongoing therapy.  I take one in the morning and one in the evening.  I try to keep my dosage schedule very precise because I pretty quickly show signs of withdrawal if I miss any.  It has allowed me to start physical therapy; which was previously unavailable because of the pain.  I feel much better but this is an ongoing disease that is not curable only controllable so I don't know what the future holds and if the treatment will change...

I have had fibromyalgia for 13 plus years and was excited about the FDA finally approving Lyrica for fibromyalgia patients.  I would recomend that anyone suffering from fibromyalgia try this medication; along with a healthy diet and exercise. Lyrica is not a cure; but I have improved probably 75% over this last year.,It took my body 3-4 weeks to get used to Lyrica.  It did make me feel a little different "high" would probably be the best way to describe it.  I have since adjusted and have had no further side effects.,Started with 50 mg 2x a day (morning and afternoon); then gradually built up to 150mg 2x a day.

I was plagued with upset stomach; constipation followed by diahrea; loss of balance; and the inability to remember words.  The night of the last day I took the medication I was unable to sleep due to the headache and therefore discontinued taking it.  ,I was prescribed 75 mf of Lyrica to be taken twice daily for seven days with and increase to 150 twice daily to follow.

Originally; I has been places on a dose of 200mg three times a day; which I believe what was recommended for fibromyalgia. The resultant relief of pain was pretty good. However; I found myself very tired and mentally dull. I switched doctors and was given the reduced dosage of 75mg. twice a day. Although my pain relief results have not been as good; I do still have some relief while at the same time being able to be more alert and functional.

She was diagnosed with Ehlers-Danlos syndrome type 3. She was then referred to the pain clinic to get some help with the increasing pain from her condition.  Their she met an anastheologist who prescribed Lyrica.  She was started on a low dose and increased gradually and after some trial and error settled on 100 mg 2xday.

I did have several colds the second year so it may have lowered my immunity.  These side affects was worth the benefits for me,I was first given 75 mg once a day and realized the medicine didn't last 24 hours so I started on twice daily doses and that helped.  I needed a little more pain reliever and started Tramadol along with the Lyrica.  I would take extra Tramadol if necessary; which provided relief at times when pain spiked.

The only reason I decided to take the meds in the first place was because a nurse friend of mine also convinced me I should take the meds. They were both wrong.

I don't take as many Methedone a day as I did pain pills because Methadone is long lasting so I guess it did help me.,At first I got painful headaches but that subsided after continued use. I do still have horrible constipation and  I have sexual dsyfuntion.,I began recieving Methadone when I was 21 years old. I started seeing a pschiatrist because I needed help for pain pill addiction. I began getting prescriptions for hydrocodone when I was 19. I have an abnormality in my lower back which causes me severe pain. I began taking more than I was supposed to for the pain and was taking anywhere from 20 to 30 pain pills a day. So I knew I needed help. That's when my doctor gave me Methadone. He gave me 60mg a day but I usually only took 40mg depending on what I needed. Over the years I have weaned myself down to 20mg a day and everyone even my doctor says to me that I should be able to come off of these pills easily but no one understands the physical and psychological symptoms I go through. It's so hard to just stop taking them when I have became so depended on them in my daily life. I have four kids and with out them I feel like a different person and it takes everything in me to get out of bed and take care of my kids. Is it in my head? I don't know but either way; in a lot of ways it helped me but in a lot of ways it ruined my life. I don't want to be addicted to a pill for the rest of my life. Now my doctor has stopped giving them to me because he feels that I can come off them easily at such a low dose but what does he know he does not understand what it feels like. I am at such a downfall in my life; I have to buy them now just to feel normal every day. I feel like if these doctors give them to me then they should help me with the withdrawals ao I can get off them. I still need help after all these yesrs. I don't have a car to drive to a methadone clinic everyday and no one to help me. So what are people like me to  do?

Methadone has allowed me to get my "bearings" underneath me; and really focus on what is important in life once again. After about 6 months; I began working and have been promoted consistently since then.  I am currently tapering and am really trying to be smart about it.  While I am very eager to be off methadone; I also do not want to rush it.  I feel that methadone should be one of the last options a person looks to when trying to stop opiate use because it isn't something that can be stopped whenever a person feels ready.  I have found it to be quite a complex task.  ,WEIGHT GAIN; WEIGHT GAIN; WEIGHT GAIN!!  I don't know if it's just because of the methadone slowing your metabolism; or if it is caused by the need to eat sweets but I have gained at least 90 lbs since starting methadone 7 years ago. It is likely a combination of both.  I have also seen a sever decline with my teeth; and the only cause I can think of is methadone.  I have taken such good care of my teeth; as far as self care and making sure I see the dentist every 6 months; and that still hasn't helped.  Has anyone else noticed this?  I have started having sever pain in my joints as well; especially my knees.  I can honestly say though; that without this medication I probably wouldn't be alive to experience any of these minor side effects.  Without a doubt; methadone along with the therapy I received while in the clinic and my families support has saved my life. I will take the weight gain and minor discomfort any day; at least I am here to write about it.,I had tried many times to get sober before beginning MMT.  I started methadone after 3 unsuccessful tries at in-patient and outpatient therapy.  When I first began treatment; I traveled 2 hours a day to received the dosage.  After about a year I was lucky enough to get in to a clinic closer to my home but by that time; I had completed all of the necessary counseling hours and had also received all clean swabs and urine tests and was given 3 day take homes.  Eventually that was extended to 6 days which is the most in my state or clinic that you are allowed. It has been about 7 years now; and I am in a total good place in life and feel that it's time to start tapering.  I have held the same job for almost 5 years; have a car; have my finances somewhat in order and am ready to move on to the next phase.  While I have had a relatively easy time of tapering; I had to stop for a couple of weeks because I started feeling some slight stomach cramping and body aches.  I made the decision to go down 2 mgs a week in hopes that such a small amount per week would allow my body to easily adjust to the change.  So far so good and I am hoping that by next summer I will be completely done.

Also; I could return to work much faster than expected.,there were no side effects that i could tell.  i returned to work after 3 days in pain.,i followed the directions and everything worked well.  I was not dizzy or lightheaded or any other problems that I noticed consciosly.

I was told it would take 6 weeks for the medicine to accumulate and become completely effective.  It did not produce any results that were apparent.  Not in inflammation reduction or in pain reduction due to the inflammation were any results ascertainable.  I suffered while waiting for this medication to do anything.  Further; you are told to consume food to protect the lining of your stomach from this medication.  Not always something you want to do when you are experiencing a lot of pain because pain can make you feel like vomiting.,Stomach issues; burning  The more adverse affect was the constant pain due to the continuing inflammation with the added and increasing reduction in movement; and muscle usage.  Worst; was the waste of time.  Another med could have been prescribed in the time I used this medicine that would have been more effective and time healing would not have been wasted.  In fact; another anti-inflammatory was prescribed that provided immediate benefits (30 minutes) without the build-up in your system that the M.D. and pharmacist said Naprosyn requires before it becomes effective.,Tried various dosages from the lowest; to more frequency.  It simply had little affect on inflammation or pain.  No other pain medication was added to this treatment and no other medication was given.  I had a car accident and suffered whiplash; thoracic muscle strain; herniation of entire lumbar region; etc.  Inflammation was rampant from hip level up.  Any relief would have been noted and appreciated.  Another drug was later prescribed; another anti-inflammatory; which proved just how much the naprosyn did not work.  I had immediate pain relief in 30 minutes and notable inflammation reduction very quickly.  In fact; after a 3 week loading of this drug; I was able to get out of bed; move around; and be functional!  The Doctor insisted on trying this level; Naprosyn; first and then changed after 6 weeks; to supposedly stronger medication in some kind of protocol progression.  I now tell my doctors which medication works and refuse anything else.  They waste time on ineffective medications allowing suffering.  I saw the doctors within the 6 week period declaring and their noting how ineffective this medication was.

EVENTUALLY; I DECIDED TO DISCONTINUE THE DRUG AND UNLIKE DENIALS FROM MANY DOCTORS; THE SIDE EFFECTS FROM WITHDRAWAL FROM THIS DRUG WERE HORRIBLE. I EXPERIENCED EXTREME ANXIETY; INTENSE SWEATING; AND TERRIBLE NIGHTMARES. IT WAS APPROXIMATELY 3 MONTHS BEFORE I BEGAN TO FEEL HUMAN AGAIN; EXCEPT FOR THE EXCRUATING PAIN FROM THE NEUROPATY IN MY BACK.,I SUFFERED A THORACIC HERNIATION WITH SPINAL CORD COMPRESSION AND UNDERWENT A DISCECTOMY BUT UNFORTUNALY 3 MONTHS LATER SCAR TISSUE GRABBED A NERVE AND I UNDERWENT A RHIZOTOMY TO SEVER THE NERVE. I WAS LEFT WITH SEVERE DEEP NERVE ROOT NEUROPATHY OF THE SPINAL CORD. THE TREAMENT WAS NARCOTICS AND AN ANTI-SEIZURE.

The sleep difficulty was caused by a horrible reaction to another medication called Celexa; which appeared to sensitize my nervous system even after the Celexa was stopped.  Ever since taking the Celexa my nervous system has been exquisitely sensitive; with symptoms such as pain; heart palpitations; restless legs; and other such things that totally interrupted my ability to fall asleep and stay asleep.,None,Used 400-500 mg at bedtime.

Very gently; not like a pain pill. Several times I got off it; and about 48 hours later was in severe pain. ,It makes me less tolerant of heat; sun. I have a problem with this anyway; and when the dose was increased from 800 mg/d to 1200 mg/d; I came near to heat stroke when outside. ,I was put on this by Rheumatology; 12 years ago. Dose was 800 mg/d until spring of 2007; I asked for it to be increased. After the near heat stroke from riding the riding lawn mower less than an hour; I decreased the dose back to 800 mg/d until cooler weather; then went back to the 1200/d.

It was only moderately successful and the side effects were quite a challenge. It was used as a standard prophylactic treatmemt against frequent migraines.

It seems to be effective but I feel I need a hire dosage as the longer I take it the more I experience relapses.I first started out with 300mg three times a day but it was ineffective.

The gabapentin potentiates the hydrocodone wonderfully.  It allows me to sleep better also.  It doesn't knock me out; just allows me to go to sleep when I want; dream; and wake up not groggy. I've also had fewer migraines since I've been on the gabapentin.,Very very mild and occasional dizziness; usually when used in combination with imitrex.  ,I take 100 mg three times a day; with hydrocodone; and three hundred mg at night before bed.

Maybe some people are more responsive to these kind of treatment; unfortunately not in my case. ,I did not experience many side effects; even though I was taking many pain medications at a time; I could say very little drowsiness; but compared with other people taking the same medication; I would say I tolerated quite well the medication. ,still believe that drugs are effective and are indicated in specific conditions; but I also Know that not everybody responds in the same way to medication.

The pain in my legs from the RLS is considerably lessoned.  I also was in chronic pain from my arthritis; but can now move around without any pain; (unless I lift or do any type of work that is strenuous); but I used to be in so much pain that I would cry; so it was definitely worth it for me to take Neurontin.,None.,Three 600 mg. tabs in the a.m. and three 600 mg. tabs at bedtime.
patient,41,female,migraines,none,Imitrex injections upon start of migraines,Neurontin (Gabapentin) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antimanic-Agents Calcium-Channel-Blockers Excitatory-Amino-Acid-Antagonists Parkinsons-Disease,1,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,1200 mg. per day  taken 3 times per day for the period of 4 years,My migraines did decrease significantly while on this medication. There was a clear inverse correlation between my Neurontin dosage and my migraine frequency and severity (more neurontin; fewer migraines),sleepiness I experienced was awful. This diminished somewhat but never entirely over the four years I took it. A couple of times I had to pull over while driving; staying awake seemed to be out of my control entirely. The sleepiness was overwhelming at times. I once fell asleep while speaking one on one with a coworker. While on Neurontin I also had an annoying tendency to forget what I was saying mid-sentence--very embarrassing in a professional setting. Since abandoning Neurontin and switching to Lamictal I no longer have this problem.,Used as a migraine prophylactic; my Dr. simply increased my dosage over time from what I believe was 300mg. per day up to 2400 over approximately two months. I was to take the medicine throughout the day but I sometimes opted to take a bulk of the total dose at night before bed--the fatigue it produced in me did assist my sleep. Unfortunately no matter when I took it my sleep was also assisted while in my car or at my desk at work! This decreased over time but was still in certain circumstances a danger. I will say however; it did decrease my migraines--the greater my neurontin dose the less my migraines. But I opted to take my migraines over falling asleep driving; possibly killing others or myself. Unfortunately my physician did not take this side effect seriously the many times I told her; after three years of this she continued to insist this side effect would subside. It did lessen but NEVER subsided to a safe level. She's no longer my physician and I now take Lamictal.

No need to get up during night to void; also fantastic.,Excessive daytime sleepiness; difficulty concentrating and retaining information; craving sweets which worsen my hypoglycemia; among others.   ,Initial 300mg was taken for only 2 days; due to severe daytime sleepiness in AM.  Found it nearly impossible to drag myself out of bed in am.  My morphine controlled release wears off within 8-9 hours; so staying in bed NOT advisable without another dose of morphine or Percocet; but the neurontin makes me want to keep sleeping.  When I finally do wake up; minimally after 11 hours after I fell asleep; I still felt tired; and now in a lot of back; hip and sometimes even knee pain; from laying in bed motionless for so long; on L side of body.  Because of the sleepiness side effect; I do not take any during day. Since my MD would not lower dosage from 300mg until next monthly visit; I bought empty size 0 gel capsules at local health food store; and painstakingly divided the dosage from the 300mg capsules into 2 150mg capsules.  Initially; this seemed to be a good solution.  I was able to continue having 8h of pain-free sleep; and getting up after 8h was easier.   But; after only 4 days at the lower 150mg dosage; the excessive sleepiness after 8h of normal sleep continued; so I need to try cutting down the dosage even more.  Have to take the dextroamphetamine controlled release; to fully wake me up in AM; and once that wore off after 12 hours in early evening; I am too tired to study for my classes.  Overall; I would recommend this drug only for adults who do not have to drive to work; or adults who can take naps during work hours; or adults who are not trying to taking classes for credit.  I am hoping the upcoming RFA procedure will allow me to stop taking the narcotics and neurontin; and allow me to be able to work; study and retain what I learn in class (especially short term memory).

The Neurontin eventually blocked my pain so well I was able to get out of bed after being stuck in it for 4 1/2 months.  These two pain relievers work so very well together.  There is nothing that is going to take all of the pain away.  I am also on other medication for this as well. Being able to walk around again finally; was like; what took you so long to figure it out what to do?  I'm not broken; I'm hurt.  I have children at home; I need to at least be mobile!,Many of the medications I take have a side effect that affects your memory.  My short term memory is terrible.  I can be asking for something as ordinary as a fork; a pen; etc. and can not come up with the word; at all.  I'll be able to later; or the next day; I haven;t forgotten the word; I just can;t get it out of my brain.  The Neurontin has also affected my eyes.  I sometimes have problems focusing; sometimes I am able to read the phone book and othertimes I need magnifying glasses.  This all started a week after starting the medicine.,I have a torn lumbar disk.  I have pain in my back that is constant and gets worse with overwork and high humidity.  I have no feeling in my feet.  My right leg does not work correctly.  The Neurontin is mainly attributable to the quality of life that I have today.  Then the other medications I take all do their part.  The Nerontin blocks the pain nerve signal from registering in my brain.  The Methodone deals directly with the pain as does the Lidoderm Patch.  The muscle relaxer keeps my muscles from spontaneously contracting; which they will do without the medication.  The anti-depressents help me stay positive; which is where I want to be.  I usually have a sunny outlook and the medicine helps me keep it.  When my last medicine stopped working; I was depressed for a total of 6 months.  What a waste of time.

My pain is significantly reduced because of these two medications; though not completely gone.  The side effects; to my knowledge; have been minimal; especially compared to what it could be without these medications.  Could a different medication work better?  Maybe.,It's hard to say what the side effects might be.  I sometimes have trouble thinking or speaking my thoughts concisely; moodiness; somewhat depressed; shortness of breath at times; dizziness; occasional vision problems; some numbness or odd sensations in legs or arms etc.  However; I can't say for sure if any of these side effects/symptoms are from taking Neurontin; the lidoderm patch or for some other reason (stresses...).,Ten years ago I had spinal chord surgery to remove a tumor.  Fortunately it was benign.  The down side is that it pressed on the nerves so much that it permanently damaged them.  The greatest nerve pain I have is from the center of my chest all the way around on the right side (breast area) to the center of my back on the right.  The skin in that area is so sensitive that any clothing even slightly rubbing on it can cause great pain.  I have been very happy with Neurotin for the most part.  I know it is working because if I am late taking my next dose (every eight hours) the pain starts to increases.  The Neurotin alone does not work well.  In addition; I have to wear a Lidoderm patch.  This has made a huge difference.  Now; after nine years I'm beginning to feel my medication isn't working as well as it used to and am planning to review these changes with my doctor.

I have on rare occasions noticed some dizziness; although I am not sure I can attribute that to the drug (I have low blood pressure because of my spinal cord injury that can sometimes cause that to happen as well).,I take the medication three times a day as prescribed; drinking at least a cup of water with each dose.  I was originally taking a smaller dose of the gabapentin; but after about six months my thumb pain started to become more frequent again.  However; my doctor prescribe me a higher dose and that helped.  I do still have problems with the pain from time to time; but not at all like I used to.  All in all the drug has made a huge difference in my life thus far.

I don't remember ever having any real pain; other than an annoying ache in both legs. I feel as though I am walking in wet fishing boots.  There is a buzzing in my legs and feet. It has over the past several years crept up from my ankles to above my knees. With all this I do very well walking a slow pace - sometimes like a drunken Sailor. I walk down 101 stairs  tale a short walk and come back up 2 at a time (slowly) holding onto a rail (now)., Side Effects:: Memory and problem solving - Constant tiredness; lack of interest. Hard to concentrate on necessary Paperwork - i.e. Taxes (TurboTax) Last year I had no problem with concentrating or filling in the forms on the program. Now I have a hard time even sitting down to do it. I was motivated - now I've lost the drive to get the job done - and I know I have to do it. I have trouble understanding. I used to look forward to using TurboTax - what I understood last year I can't seem to follow this year.,Treatment Details: Take 1 Gaberpentin capsule (300MG) by mouth three times a day.

This addition finally got the seizures completely under control. ,As I stated; increasing the dosage of this medication finally got my epilepsy under control.

I also suffer from depression and a panic disorder that may be helped from this drug; but I think that that may be true indirectly; as I think the elimination of the seizures has been the main cause of the relief; particularly the anxiety.,As I stated; increasing the dosage of this medication finally got my epilepsy under control.

I was out of control on the meds and I felt as though my children would be better off without me.

I trusted the medical specialists and was in so much pain I would have done anything to make it stop. They started me on 300mg gabapentin slowly increased every 2nd day until I was taking 10;000 mg per day. yes you read it correct 10;000mg. The legal dose in NZ 3;600mg.

I have been trying to decrease theses meds for two years and don't feel like I have achieved much some days. to date I take 3x 300mg 4 times a day 3;600mg (done this alone).  I have been to doctors ans specialists about side effects and feel they just dismiss them yet they come under criteria of serious side effects. I'm now the too hard basket. No help or support here with DPH or any medical facility. I have my children and Friends that help as much as they can. I desperation to come off this crap I started smoking marijuana that was more beneficial to help keep decreasing and control intense pain until recently convicted for growing my own medicine. In my opinion Gabapentin is such a dangerous drug and will be the undoing of many people. Here in NZ its all care no responsibility

I have also prescribed it for neuropathic patient. Most patients experience no benefit; or if there is any benefit; it occurs at small doses. Titrating the dose up seems to worsen side effects without providing any added benefit. In addition; it is a costly drug.

Using no other meds I have taken this in the past with no side effects. I have been taking gabapentin for about a month.Does well with my depression.Only took about a week to feel better.Strange but true.,I also take hydrocodone for chronic kidney stones and back pain. Upon mixing Gabapentin and Hydrocodone I turned into a raging ; hateful person. I was hateful to my family and could not stand myself!I wanted to hurt myself and others. Taking these two meds together changed my whole personality.It is clear that I cannot take these two together.  I will stay on the Gabapentin but will only take Hydrocodone when I am in extreme pain! It seems to help others when taking Hydrocodone and Gabapentin together but I will NEVER do this again.Gabapentin makes me sleep well.

I'm not sure whether or not it affected my bowels returning to normal function.,At first I was given the oxycodone intravenously; with a button allowing me to choose when I wanted a dose (don't remember the amount) but limited in total amount and frequency (up to every 15 minutes; I think.) Afterwards; I took it in pill form. After several days I decided the side effects were too strong and  got a hydrocodone prescription; which had similar but more mild side effects. In retrospect; I wish that acupunture had been available; when I experienced an auricular 5-needle protocol several weeks later; I found the residual pain I had was immediately reduced; with none of the side effects.

I think it only blocked the pain receptor in my brain but didn't actually provide a cure for the main problem. It was like a mask that may have caused more damagae in the end,I became severely addicted to the drug. With flu like symptoms when out of meds. I became dependant on the meds everyday to function and because it was working for enabling me to go about my day I didn't look for a proper treatment.

It is recommended to take on a full stomach; though I've never noticed an issue when I haven't.

Therefore I was becomming addicted to this drug as I was depending on it to relieve my pain. I also noticed that while taking this drug I was becoming constipated where in the past that has never been an issue for me. ,This medication was prescribed to me following my knee arthroplasty. I had a surgery done on my knee where the joints have been replaced. following the surgery I had severe pain and so the doctor as opposed to morphine prescribed OxyContin.

Rest is a must while taking this medication.  Its better if you do not drive and perform intensive activities right after taking this medication.  It is a very strong medication and since I have a petite physique; I did think that the dose was a bit too high for me.  I felt very light headed and drowsy after taking th epill but i must say the pill does do its job.   ,The pill was prescribed to me for recovering from pain after my wisdom teeth were extracted.  It was a very effective pain killer.  All of my wisdom teeth were extracted the same day and I was in excruciating pain once the anesthetic wore off.  As soon as I took thi smedication; I felt great relief.  I was prescribed only 5 pills but I felt much better after taking only 3; 1 every 4 hours.

Side effects were terrible; however:  Severe itching; anxiety; insomnia; dry mouth; nausea.  After taking one dose at 6pm; I felt tired and fell asleep at 11:30.

It might have been move effective if I had taken it before pain started. As it was; it took about two hours to get relief.,Main effects were nausea; light headedness and room spining.,Drug prescribed for pain after surgery.  If I had taken  drug a few hours after surgery; anticipating the incision might be become painful; the outcome might have been different. Because I waited; I took one pill about 9 p.m.; another about 11 p.m. and it was not until midnight that I got any relief.  The next morning; I was nauseous and and light headed. I don't take any medication; so the impact of the drug in my system  was noticeable and not pleasant. On second day after surgery; I took a couple of Advil.  After that;  nothing.

It is not an opiate however it does provide pain relief (for me) along the lines of a mild narcotic without the "euphoric" or mind numbing effects. It allows me greater latitude of neck movement. It is very evident to me when the medication is wearing off as I can no longer turn my neck more than approximately 25 degrees. This drug has been a lifesaver for me and can sometimes even head off my milder migraines.,I've personally experienced no side effects other than an occasional jerky type feeling in my movements. I have heard from others that this medication; although non narcotic can be difficult to cease due to withdrawal symptoms. Personally I have  had no problem with this. This medication has been known to cause seizures and is not to be taken by anyone who has experienced a seizure.,I take two 50 mg. tablets as needed up to three times a day.

Didn't end up limping at the end of the day or after a 30 min car ride.  It made me feel like I was in my 30's again instead of my 50's.  It enables me to do yoga moves which I could not do because of the pain.  It's changed my life.  None of the side effects that narcotic pain relievers give.

Kind of warm and fuzzy.  Very relaxed.,I had a tummy tuck sx and was prescribed Oxycodone for the first week and it knocked me on my butt!  So my PS switched me to Tramadol.  She told me it would help with the pain; but not as well.  But I think it actually helped more and since I was in a normal state of mind I could actually feel the effects.  Tramadol is great for moderate pain and wont drug you up like Hydrocodne or Oxycodone does.
patient,36,female,Fibromyalgia,Chronic Fatigue,none,Ultram (Tramadol) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Opioid-Analgesics Opioid-Analgesics,8,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects, 50mg  taken 2 x a day for the period of 2 years,The Tramadol helped minimally at first.  I did stop working for the pain.  I've continued to take it because it helped dramatically for the fatigue; without any jitters.  I honestly could not get out of bed in the morning if it weren't for this drug.,At first; it took my body some time to adjust.  It revved up my system.,My doctor didn't know much about Fibromyalgia; so the only thing he prescribed was the Tramadol.
patient,62,female,hand pain,premenopause- menopause,celebrex occasionally; Motrin occasionally,Ultram (Tramadol) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Opioid-Analgesics Opioid-Analgesics,8,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,100 mg q 12 hours  taken daily when having bouts of pain for the period of Off and on for last ten years,     Since I tried to avoid the GI effect of Motrin; or celebrex if used too long; the tramadol seemed a good alterntive.  I took it in the morning; and it generally seemed to energize me enough so that I stayed active; and if it didn't relieve the pain; It seemed to keep me from thinking about it and I remained busy.,  I did find that if I took it in the late afternoon; I really   couldn't sleep at night; mymind raed and I felt unsettled.   It reduced my appetite a bit; ad I would work without eating; or drinking.  Had to remind myself to eat.,     I have degenerative joint desease in both my hands.  Took the standrd painkillers; not narcotics; but asa; tylenol; motrin; and then Celebrex.  The best was celebrex; but there is a danger with taking it long term.  Ultram ws prescribed at first as 50mg twice a day.  This wasn't at all effective.  So we upped the dose; and this worked well; except not at night. Since then I hae had boththumb joints replaced; and althoughI still have a prescription for the Ultram; I rarely use it... sometimes for back aches.  Someone once told me it is an opiate derivative.  If so; it does not seem to have an addictive quality; or any withdrawal symptoms; at least not the way I have used it.

Also; unlike some of the anti-inflammatory drugs I had taken in the past; I was not drowsy or sluggish during the day and I felt as if I could function normally.,In the beginning I had very slight dizziness that would quickly subside and immediately noticed a significant decrease in appetite. After about 2 months it did not seem to work as well for the pain as it hd been. I also had what felt like strong muscle spasms that made my entire body twitch; but only for a second and only once in a while.  Therefore; I decided that I would discontinue taking the medication.  That is when my problems began.,I was told by my doctor and pharmacist that this was a non-addictive medication; but when I quit taking it the withdrawal symptoms were extreme.  I had cold chills;severe body aches; diarrhea; nausea; headache; heart palpitations; anxiety; sweating; dizziness; vomiting and depressed feelings. I got a refill prescription to gradually come off of it after that and it occurred once again.  I have never had substance abuse issues but after doing some research learned that it is opiate-based and highly addictive. I have never felt that kind of pain and sickness in my life and pray I never do again. I have heard similar experiences from others as well. I would not recommend this drug and do not believe that it is not addictive.  From now on; I will do my homework before I take anything else. I now use OTC pain relievers and I encourage everyone who reads this to do the same before beginning treatment with tramadol or any pain reliever.

It was the only drug that could give me any relieve before I had surgery to fuse the vertebrae between C6 and C7 in my neck. It did not eliminate the pain completely; but made it very tolerable., I had and still continue to have few side side effects. I had a decrease in appetite. ,    I took 1 to 2 tablets three times a day prior to surgery. After surgery I took and continue to take 1 to 2 pills a day as needed.

The drug gave me a sense of Euphora which allowed me to deal with the pain better. It gave me a comforting sensation and allowed me to sleep good. My mood changed for the better; almost as if I were high.It actually motivated me to do the things i would normally be too lazy to do. This medication put me in a good mood and a carefree mood.,I would have mild itching ,I began taking this medication as prescribed but it put me in such a good mood I began taking more...and needing more. It works great for anxiety also but when I stopped taking it I had the most horrible withdrawls. I could not sleep. My insides felt like they were jumping. I was awfully tired and depressed. I could not keep my arms and legs still when i sat down. It was horrible. I WAS ADDICTED TO THIS MEDICATION AND I STILL AM.  I am still trying to wean off of it. I DO NOT RECOMMEND THIS MEDICINE TO ANYONE. Especially if you've had an addiction problem with any other pain meds. BEWARE!!!!!!!!

I like that it's not a narcotic; yet gives some of the benefits of one.,Because it only took away part of the pain I thought it would be OK to take 2 more tablets.  That was a really bad idea.  I started to feel pressure in my head; I felt like I was going to faint; my lips started to tingle.  The worst effect though was that about 3 min after my heart started going extremely fast then started skipping over and over.  It was very scary.  I then read that a person can die from and overdose.  I feel like I dodged death.  Very important! take this as prescribed.,This med was the drug of choice for me since I am in recovery for alcohol.

I could not stop taking it without experiencing physical withdrawal. [Sweating; night sweats; jumping out of skin; jittery nerves; lethargy; fatigue; depression.] I took it over a year just because I could not NOT take it. Finally; I quit cold turkey; suffered the withdrawal for about two days. Took over 8 months until the nerve jumps in my skin stopped at night.,I wanted a non-addictive drug since I am a recovering alcoholic so my doctor thought this was the ticket. The withdrawal was not worth the pain it initially alleviated. I would not have taken it had I known this would happen. I would have simply dealt with the back pain by altering my routine and lifestyle instead.

After I take the medicine these symptions disappear. Its almost like withdrawal.,Medicine was prescribed to be taken twice a day in combination with physcial therapy for back condition.

After all conventional methods of treatment (e.g.; exercises; mouth appliances etc.) and drugs (e.g; ibuprofen) did not alleviate the problem; symptoms or pain; the only option left was surgery.  Because surgery for TMJ conditions is not a guarantee for success; I was reluctant to agree to the procedure.

Also experienced cold sweats.,Vicodin (Hydrocodone and Acetaminophen) was prescribed at one to two 500mg tablets every four to six hours.  The drug induced deep sleep; followed by restlessness; heavy nausea; and extremem dizziness.  Discontinued use of the drug after three days due to severity of side effects.

This worked much better in my opinion.  I subsequently refused any additional prescriptions for vicodin and requested tylenol with codeine instead.  I have since switched to a natural pain relief option that is a combination of white willow; feverfew; skullcap; and kelp.  It is called "Relief".  I believe the manufacturer is "Nature's Way."  Although; I am in daily pain for assorted issues (structural) I avoid medicating myself unless it is particularly dibilitating.  If I really need to take something I will take the Relief or plain Aspirin.  Dramatically fewer side effects; no hazard of addiction; just as effective.  Given the high level of reported addictiveness of this drug; I would never take it again nor recommend anyone else take it.
patient,53,female,diverticulitis / kidney infection, lower back pain,antibiotics,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,10/500  (dosage frequency: every 4 to 6 hours depending on the pain)  for the period of almost two weeks,reduced the intensity of the pain and allowed for rest to recuperate,I had no queasiness or nausea; no jittery feelings.

For me; vicodin has literally no noticable side effects; of course I only took a limited amount for acute pain; which was relieved 100%.,I felt no palpable side effects. I also was very cautious to take no more than what I needed; not only because it can be habit forming but because it can cause constipation which was the last thing I wanted!,I was instructed to take every eight hours however I found that I only needed a half pill and subsequently only took three pills; actually I took two and a half and stoll felt no pain.
patient,40,female,Pain from broken arm,Broken in two places; frozen shoulder,None,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,can't remember!  (dosage frequency: every 6 hours)  for the period of 2 weeks,It took the "edge" off the pain; for sure.  Without the medication I don't know how I could have put up with it.  ,I was so out of it from the one pill; mouth hanging open; drooling; to take I had to cut it in half.  I also experienced digestive distress; and overall yucky feeling; not some blissfully pain free state. My arm was shattered..the bone was separated about 1/2 an inch at the upper arm; and a crack ran down a few inches to another break.  It was excruciating; but the 1/2 pill was enough to dull the pain to the point where I could sleep; and make it up to go to the restroom.  ,  The Vicodin was for the pain of the broken arm.  The arm was in a plastic type of cast and sling.  After 8 weeks I was able to remove the sling but the shoulder had "frozen" by then so the physio required was just as painful!  
patient,26,female,pain relief - toothache,severe lower back pain,none,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,15mg / 750mg  taken 30 tablets; to be taken as needed for the period of took it over the course of 2 months,was later prescribed Codeine after the procedure; which only dulled the pain to half intensity.,Mild drowsiness accompanied by a sense of well-being or euphoria.  Side effects were enjoyable; so I was especially careful to take it only as needed to reduce risk of dependency.  The combined effect of pain relief and "nice feelings" make this a risky drug to take if you are susceptible to addiction.,back went out suddenly one day and I was unable to stand or walk without excruciating pain.  I took the last two Vicodin in one dose and the moment I was able; went to a clinic where the doctor chastized me for having a narcotic.  The onset of pain relief was rapid; the side effects took longer to present; but when they did; they were more marked.  Same amount of drowsiness; heavy limbs; and a trance-like state.
patient,22,female,burn from motorcycle accident,None,None,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,2 pills twice a day  taken 2 pills twice a day for the period of 1 week,The treatment made the pain of the accident bareable. The paid seised for six hours before another dosage was needed.,The treatment was effective for reducing paid however I felt extremely depressed while taking the dosage. I had emotional swings and did not want to leave the house which is not common for me. Once I was no longer taking the drug I was back to normal.,I took the prescription for one week when my burn started to heal.
patient,45,female,molar extraction,none,none,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,one tablet every three hours  taken one week for the period of one week,I felt no pain from the extraction on the Vicodin.,While taking Vicoden; I was very dizzy and sleepy. I was unable to drive or function at a normal level.,I was given a prescription for the first week with an option to refill. I did not refill because I was not in a lot of pain and didn't want to continue to experience the side effects.
patient,40,female,I got my toothpulled,None,Antibiotics,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,7,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,1 or 2 pills as needed  taken twice for the period of 1  day,I took the drug shortly after having my tooth pulled.  I never noticed a great amount of pain; and contribute this to the laughing gas and novicane during the proceduce; and taking the vicadin shortly after the procedure. I took the vicadin drug twice because after several hours I started to feel pain again.  It was effective in reliefing my pain.,After taking the drug; I became sick to my stomach.  I threw up everything that I had consumed prior to the procedure.  This feeling stayed with me for several hours.  I initally thought I was sick; because I did not eat when I took the first dosage.  I then took another dose; but this time I made myself eat a little something; (I could not eat much at this point); but it mattered not...I got sick again.  I threw the rest of the presciption out.,The prescription was given to me prior to having my tooth pulled.  I never filled the prescription because I really did not notice any pain.  After the procedure; I immediately went to have the prescription filled.  I took the medication while I was still numb from the novicane.  As the novicane wore off; and the two tablets I took wore off; I took the vicadine once again. 
patient,19,female,tendonitis pain,none,none,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,3,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,200mg  taken 2x day for the period of 1 month,I took vicodin for pain in my wrist but i had to stop because it would give me a headache everytime i took it. So i can't really say there were any benefits to it; because eventough it helped with the wrist pain; the headaches were worse.,see above,This was prescribed by a physical therapist. I was also receiving the physical therapy for my wrist pain; which was from work related injury.(repetitive overuse). The pain killer was to help with the pain from just moving my hands. 
patient,35,female,shoulder & neck pain,none,none,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,5/500 mg  taken 1 tablet/day for the period of 1 day,None.  Vicodin is a narcotic for severe pain. I was prescribed it after weeks of physical therapy and ibuprophin did not reduce the pain in my shoulder and neck following a ski crash. ,Much to my dismay; the drug made me feel extremely nauseated. Though I did not actually throw up; I felt like it for a day. Furthermore; the pain in my neck and shoulder did not improve. Even if it had; I would have discontinued Vicodin anyway. ,My doctor did not mention any possible side effects; nor did he tell me it is a narcotic. Apparently; it is a drug of abuse. Also; nausea is a common side effect. I was only told that it was a pain killer that would alleviate my discomfort. 
patient,68,female,herniated disc,none,none,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,5/500  (dosage frequency: 1 every 4-6 hrs)  for the period of 3 weeks,severe pain; I took 1 1/2 tablets which helped.,Made be slightly sleepy but was able to function normally.,was particularily helpful at night. Before going to bed; I took one or one and a half tablets and was able to sleep quite well. Otherwise; I was very uncomfortable and was losing sleep.

The prescription took the pain away.,There were no side effects.,I had a facelift and the doctor prescribed this drug for any pain associated with the surgery.  I only had to take the medication for approximately two days; possibly 3 but it was totally effective as a pain killer.  I would take it again.
patient,46,female,Periodontal surgery,none,prescription mouth rinse,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,(1) 7.5/750 TB every 4-6 hours  (dosage frequency: once or twice a day)  for the period of 3-4 days,There was a significant reduction in mouth pain. I was able to relax following periodontal surgey and not worry about family obligations and responsibilities.,I had drowsiness; dizziness; ichy at night with some nausea and dizziness in the mornings.,I was prescribed vicoden in case I had measurable pain following peridontal gum surgery. I was presribed to take the Vicoden PRN for pain every 4-6 hours.

It took effect within 30 minutes and lasted several hours.,No side effects were experienced while taking it.,Vicodin and Ibuprofin were prescribed together for the management of pain. The initial dose was highly effective and lasted several hours; however; each subsequent dose resulted in only moderate pain relief and produced a "foggy" feeling.  I do not feel that I would have been capable of driving while taking vicodin.  I would most likely not take it again.
patient,56,female,nausea; headaches; dizziness,none,none,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,1,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,5 mg ?????  taken as needed for pain for the period of 3 days,reactions over-road the benefits.  I will simply say that I did not think I received benefits from this particular drug.  There are other pain inhibitors that worked as well as the vicodin with out the druggy feelings and sickness.,headaches; nausea; druggy feelings; heaviness; just an overall sense of malaise.  Felt like I was in a drug induced stupor.  Very uncomfortable and unacceptable.,to control pain after surgery
patient,30,female,Surgery recovery,None,None,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,4,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,As needed  (dosage frequency: i took it as needed / tolerated)  for the period of About a week,Relieved pain; helped me fall asleep,I had severe constipation and nausea; along with some onfusion; dizziness; and cramping.  ,I stopped taking Vicodin and switched to over the counter tylenol as a remedy because the side effects were so severe and negative.  I was constantly; severely nauseated after taking Vicodin.  My body did not tolerate this drug well at all. 
patient,54,female,post hemorrhoidectomy,MCS,none,Vicodin (Hydrocodone / Acetaminophen) ,Analgesics-Pain-Relievers Antitussives Opioid-Analgesics,3,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,5-15 mg/every 4 hrs  taken every 4 hrs for the period of 1 day,Eliminated severe pain post surgery,Caused dry heave vomiting,Vomiting to the point of dry heaving is just not acceptable; for one; keeping the medication or anything down can't happen and for two; well putting that kind of pressure on the hemorrhoidectomy surgery site is not a good thing at all.  My doctor said to keep taking the medication; but I don't think his brain was working.  Dry heaves means you have vomited up your bile and NOTHING is staying down and you are still heaving nothing.  That was my body's "reaction" to vicodin; it was like poison to me. 
patient,54,female,to relax muscles,severe pain right side upper going around to the back,Warfrin & Zydol,Diazepam ,Anesthesia-Adjuvants Anesthetics Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,3,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,2mg  taken two tablets three times daily for the period of two weeks,The Zydol was effective in reducing my pain after the dose was increased from 50 mg to 100 mg.  The Diazepam made me sleep all the time which was a good thing as I believe the body heals while sleeping,I will never take Diazepam again as it gave me a headache; I had unpleasant dreams and I felt that I was not always here; so trying to focus or remember things was dificult.  ,The pain in my side was found to be viral hepatitis.  I continued with Diazepam for two weeks.  Treatment then consisted of reducing fat in the diet and not drinking alcohol for 3 months.  I lost a considerable amount of weight as a result.  
patient,40,female,Anxiety,PTSD,None,Diazepam ,Anesthesia-Adjuvants Anesthetics Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,10 mg qid  taken one day for the period of one day,None,Drug-induced psychosis; resulting in 10 day commitment to a mental institution.,Many people I know - I now work as a health care professional - erroneously believe that Valium; Xanax; Ativan; and other benzodiazepines must be used "as directed" and have enhanced benefit if "built up in the brain"- ie: in ways similar to SSRI's effect on the brain over time.  I was entirely aware that diazepam is a "prn" medication; and chose to use the prescribed dosage on one particular day hoping it would carry me through a difficult situation. Unfortunately; I suffered a "paradoxical reaction" which cost me dearly in many tragic ways.  I was in a state of severe psychosis for days- because my "benzo" level was low when admitted to the hospital; I was given diazepam for an additional two days; whereupon I apparently refused to take any medication at all; and recovered as I "detoxed".  I have absolutely no memory of five days of my life.  I have done research into this phenomenon; and must warn all that this seems to occur most often in indiviguals with dopamine/GABA reuptake variants- such as those with ADHD; Parkinsons; and also PTSD.  Diazepam is a "bandaid" and offers no long-term therapeutic benefit whatsoever.  In fact; "rebound" anxiety and profound depression are common. What is most ironic is that in the medical setting; this occurs often after administration of "Versed"; is recognized quickly; and fluzanimine is given as an antidote. Outside of this scenario; the patient is blamed; treated as a suspected drug addict; and stigmatized.

The liquid capsules were then superceded by tablets which usually took about twice as long to kick in.  ie; 40 mins instead of 20. The benefit was there if I was unable to sleep otherwise but a benzo sleep is not natural and feels different to real sleep. ,Twitching nerves for several days afterward.  Difficulty sleeping.  ,Taking a pill to get to sleep.

I used to worry for two weeks about getting ono and airplane.,I will get a slight headache; a few hours after I take the drug. Usually not bad enough that it's actually painful; just annoying.,I take the diazepam about 1.5 hours before the plan takes off. Not hard to do; not that I have to get to the airport so early:).

Doeses are as required for muscle relaxation and used mostly for tension before evening stretching or massage.  Treatment has been going on for a year now with no ill effects.  I only use the drug when I feel it necessary; and have to date used less than 20% of the available doses

I do not understand why it is not given out instead of all these other antidepressants which are readily available and cause huge problems and come with awful side effects.,None to speak of except for slight tiredness.,To be taken 3 times a day; but I only took as & when necessary.

I never really felt rested though. I am not sure if the combination of these 3 drugs caused my anxiety to become worse. Venlafaxine was supposed to help my depression but I found it totally ineffective. I am wondering if I get a higher dose will it help but I am afraid it might make it worse . WOuld love to go off all of these medicines as I feel the side effects are worse than the depression,No energy; increase in anxiety and depression,before going to bed - diazepam 2mg and imovane 7.5 mg

Then after the first week I found that one tablet wasn't very effective; I had trouble falling asleep and also woke up several times during the night. I took 2 tablets for the next few days and it worked well; but after that it wasn't working well anymore so I took 4 tablets one night. The sleep was very disturbed; I kept falling in and out of sleep all night; and felt extremely drowsy and disorientated. I discontinued the use of this drug immediately as I realized I had quickly built a tolerance to it and wasn't effective anymore; even with 40mg.

After a few nights of sound sleep I can fall asleep quickly without the need for medication.  My mind is able to stop its endless racing/,I have noticed that if I do not give myself at least eight hours of sleep time this medicaiton will cause me to be very groggy in the morning.  I will have a difficult time awakening and getting myself moving.  Others tell me I look like a zombie!  So I know it's important to take the Rx w/in 15 minutes of lying awake in bed & not let too much time go by before I lose the 8 hours of sleeptime.,I have found the best way to take this medication (once I've had a few nights of my mind racing & not being able to fall asleep) is to take 30 mg. a half hour before bedtime which causes a drowsy feeling even before falling into bed.  A few ights of this procedure & my sleep cycle seems to get back on track & then I don't need the medication; until  another cycle of sleeplessness creeps into my life!

patient,44,female,anxiety,none,none,Valium (Diazepam) ,Anesthesia-Adjuvants Anesthetics Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,9,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,10-20 drops as needed  (dosage frequency: 1 -2 times a day)  for the period of 2 months,feeling more relaxed and able to go to work; the breath slowed; shaking stopped and mood improved,no side effects and no problem when stopped,just as the anxiety arised I took 10 or 20 drops depending on the strength of the symptoms and after a while I was normal again
patient,52,female,anxiety; panic disorder,none,at first none; later rivotril 2 mg at night,Valium (Diazepam) ,Anesthesia-Adjuvants Anesthetics Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,5 mg three times a day or as needed  taken as perscribed for the period of 36 yrs,I was given valium to calm me down as I couldn't take anti depressants as they gave me really severe side effects.  I found that the valium quietened my mind and slowed my body down without making me feel heavy or drugged.  It helped me cope with the stresses of every day life but also the stresses caused by my anxiety and panic disorder.  I think that is has a bad reputation possibly because people abuse it but taken as prescribed I find this drug incredibly useful and invaluable in helping me cope with things I wouldn't normally be able to do or cope with.  I get a warm feeling as it goes into my blood all the way down to my toes. I feel relaxed and happy and don't have any side effects whatsoever.  However it does make me feel a little sleepy for about half an hour after it starts working...which is actually a nice feeling when you're nervous and then I just feel relaxed.,I didn't have any side effects at all.  But it does make me sleepy for a little while in higher doses when it first starts working (YES; I can actually feel when it starts),I started having panic attacks in different places until my world became very restricted.  A doctor prescribed Valium and it helped.  I have still got worse over the years but valium still helps me cope with things like that I wouldn't normally be able to do at all; like shopping; going to the dentist; or out in public.  I feel valium has had a very bad write up...mainly I feel through abuse.  I've taken it most of my life and never took more than I was told to.  In fact I was so afraid it would "stop" working that I only took it when absolutely necessary.  This means that although I have taken it most of my life in larger or smaller doses; it still works for me and gets me though the hard times.  I don't think I have ever tried a drug that has helped me cope as well as this one has.  I hope it never gets taken off the market.  I currently take half a 5 mg tab when I have to do something I consider difficult; only taking the other half after assessing if one half is enough.  I hardly ever take more than one in a day and hardly ever more than two tabs in a week....sometimes a month.  Depending on my commitments. 
patient,35,female,sciatica and low back pain,none,none,Valium (Diazepam) ,Anesthesia-Adjuvants Anesthetics Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,5 mg  taken 1x a day for the period of 6 months,i had a severe fall and tore the psoas muscle and damaged the SI joint. Before i was in great physical shape. After I could barely walk a block. After PT which only mildly helped I asked for various meds. Vicodin helped some but left me hung over. Valium released the muscle seizures and allowed me slowly to   return to exercise. It's not used much now that there's Flexeril; but F. can lead to depression and doesn't as effectively release muscle tension (in my case). ,some sluggishness in the early morning; and sometimes an overall sense of dehydration; but that can be countered with drinking lots of fluids. ,I determined that the best solution was to take it before bed--i could sleep through the night with it; whereas without I often woke up and had to take more ibuprofen and still slept poorly.
patient,40,female,anxiety,depression due to loss of close family member,marvelon,Valium (Diazepam) ,Anesthesia-Adjuvants Anesthetics Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,5mg  taken only when necessary for the period of 3-6 months,Helped greatly in as much as wasnt crying as much and was able to sleep a little better.,only that it made me a bit lethargic but not noticeably so.,Would only take a tablet when I was feeling particularly vulnerable for example at the funeral and times when feeling overcome. I think that this is the best thing about valium you only have to take it when you really need it and it works almost immediately and for me without undesirable side effects. You just have to be careful and not take constantly for long periods of time.I know of many people who have been prescribed the newer anti depressants and have gone through the most horrendous side effects; personally I wouldnt touch them.
patient,73,female,Anxiety,none,none,Valium (Diazepam) ,Anesthesia-Adjuvants Anesthetics Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,5mg / 10mg   taken as needed for the period of 1 1/2 years as needed,when needed from normal anxiety it just relaxes body and mind... it's long lasting nature often means that   ,mental fog for couple of hours on a higher dose (i wouldn't choose this particular benzodiazepine if I felt anxiety at work as I wouldn't be able to concentrate up to the standard required.) But perfect for every other situation.,if your body has constant daily dosing for months or years your brain stopped producing natural relaxation chemicals meaning that you need more and more of the drug to get the same benefit and also because of this after years of high dosage extreme withdrawal symptoms can occur while the brain starts to produce these chemicals again. 
patient,30,female,anxiety,NA,NA,Valium (Diazepam) ,Anesthesia-Adjuvants Anesthetics Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,5 mg  taken everyday for the period of 6 months,help me sleep better and makes me calm down when I'm depress,have no side effect at all,Valium helps me with sleep and anxiety but Xanax is much better in both sleep and anxiety; valium is a long term acting medication and when you wake up in the morning you still feel sleepy and tired; where as xanax its a short term sleeping medication and when you wakeup in the morning you feel great and not sleepy; they both work good but i personally perfer xanax; I usually order them from medsheaven at www.medsheaven.com

I am not sure how long it will last; but I will take the relief for now. I have suffered with terrible back pain for going on 8 years; and until I was prescribed valium and Norco combination; I was still in excruciating pain. The combo eases the muscle spasms and basically stops all pain in my lower back. When I awake; I am hurting; but within 20 minutes of taking meds; I am my old; 25 year old self again.,I have experienced NO side effects other than feeling high; a little off-balance; and sleepy. I actually take the Valium at work and have had NO problems whatsoever;,I am very happy with my doctors prescribed meds; and hope Valium continues to work for me in the same manner it has so far. I would highly recommend this combo for anyone having back pain or anxiety. As I live and work a very hectic job; the Valium effects are a plus to keep me on an even keel; allowing me to do my work with a more mellow attitude.

After the procedure was over; the patient experienced wobbly legs and had difficulty paying attention.,Valium was prescribed for the patient to use prior to having minor surgery to relieve his anxiety.
patient,59,female,migraines; back spasm; insomnia,1 year post breast cancer,amitriptyline 50 mg; Maxalt 10 mg,Valium (Diazepam) ,Anesthesia-Adjuvants Anesthetics Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,10 mg  taken 3 times a week for the period of ongoing,I have found Valium to be a godsend. It helps stave off migraine attacks; it helps me get to sleep when I have insomnia; and it relaxes  the muscles in my back when I get spasms. I use it sparingly; only when I really need it; (about 2-3 times a week ) and I have not found it to be addictive at all. I actually find it to be relatively mild; and I think it's over-regulated.,I don't have any side effects from taking it.,My migraine attacks are directly related to muscle spasms that occur in my lower intestine. My doctor called it an "abdominal migraine." If I take a Valium when I feel a migraine coming on; it often goes away without having to take a Maxalt. I've had a mastectomy; chemo & radiation; and have been through a lot of anxiety; but I don't rely on Valium as an anti-anxiety drug. I'd be eating them like candy if I did; and then I probably would get addicted. I think Valium should be considered more of a muscle relaxant. That's how I use it; anyway.

My blood pressure is still higher than I or my doctor would like it to be. At the moment it averages about 140 over 90 but it was 180 over 110. Therefore I would say it was somewhat efficacious. It also alleviated some headaches that I assume were blood pressure related. ,I find when I am taking Micardis that I tend to be very tired and my libido is decreased.  ,I take Micardis in pill form once daily.

The next step; if one becomes necessary will be to add a sartan. Based on my previous response. I expect it to be a happy experience. ,For no apparent reason the dosage needs to be adjusted; up or down from time to time. Fortunately hypertension is not asymptomatic in this patient: have a headache; it's up; raise the dose; feel wiped out; it's down; lower the dose. All this has been confirmed by home; office; and pharmacy readings.,experience is one more validation of the benefits of early and aggressive intervention in the case of mild hypertension.
patient,50,male,Nocturnal Myoclonus (like Restless Leg Syndrome),Many conditions; including eventual heart attack,too numerous to mention; but took many ,Prinivil (Lisinopril) ,Angiotensin-Converting-Enzyme-Inhibitors Antihypertensive-Agents Cardiotonic-Agents Cardiovascular-Agents Enzyme-Inhibitors,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,10 mg  taken nightly for the period of 14 years,Nocturnal myoclonus (similar to restless leg syndrome) causes severe jerking of the legs every 15 seconds for up to 7 hours. Lisinopril allowed both myself and my partner to sleep at night. Somehow; the drug works without the adverse effects the other sleeping pills; neuro transmiter pills and anti-depressants had.,No adverse side effects; but it did keep my blood pressure down.,Though it is a blood pressure medication; I have never had high blood pressure. I have taken Xanax; Ativan; Clonipin; and many other medications to allow me to sleep; but did not stop the nocturnal myoclonus(similar to restless leg syndrome). This meant I did not remain awake to experience the effects; but my partners did get kicked violently; kept awake with my movements and dirupted sleep. Though it is not known by many doctors; the research was down many years ago on this treatment by a VA doctor while in medical school in the 70s. It has been effective for so many years when I went 15 years without getting acceptable relief.

Dry mouth and gagging at night. Nausea and the feeling of a weight on my chest. Sneezing; sore throat.  Because I have allergies; I thought they were just giving me more trouble than usual. Constipation/diarrhea. The feeling of being winded with only a moderate amount of activity. I am only 15 lbs. overweight and am used to a very active life but feel down and depressed a lot and have problems getting to sleep at night.,I had an average of 135 to 145 over 80 or 90 that is called high-normal.  But because I had a stroke in my eye; my doctor felt that I had had a spike in blood pressure that caused the problem. I was given Coreg which brought the numbers down a bit; but then my Dr. felt that lisinopril would help take it down lower along with the Coreg-which it did. But then; my allergies seem to get really horrible and my breathing got worse and worse until I mentioned all of my symptoms at my three month check up today. It wasn't my allergies; it was the medication. We stopped the lisinoprol.  I have never had such bad affects from a medication. I hope the new medication will be better; but you can bet I will check it out thoroughly before taking it.

This treatment worked most of the time.  THe only time it did not work as well was when I was ill or was having asthma related problems (difficulty breathing).  During those times; even with the lisinopril; my blood pressure went up to the pre-treatment level.,For over a year after starting the treatment I believe I had a side effect of a dry cough that was probably caused by this drug.  It was unclear whether or not it truly was caused by the lisinopril because the coughing did not stop when I temporarily halted treatment (for a few days).  When the coughing was at it's worst; my blood pressure went up; nullifying the effect of the linsinopril.,In spite of the irritating coughing; I continued taking the linsinopril and after numerous tests to rule out other causes of the coughing (one Dr. thought it was because of acid reflux); the coughing finally subsided.  After about a year of coughing; the coughing finally subsided and now (5-7 years later) I don't have any coughing whatsoever attributable to the lisinopril.

The abdominal pain increased in severity over several days; starting in lower GI and moving up to include mid and upper abdomen.  The drug was stopped for a few weeks.

So my Dr. prescribed Lisinopril and told me to take it for 3 weeks to see if it was going to be effective. After 3 weeks it was effective but I started noticing that gradually when I laid down to sleep at night; it felt like there was lots of mucous in my throat. Then the tickle started in my throat which made me feel like gagging. Then my voice was affected. It became hoarse and I noticed my throat felt soar. I searched on the internet and read about side effects from Ace Inhibitors and realized I was being negatively affected by the drug. I stopped the drug; but it has taken over a month to completely overcome the negative side effects.,Take one 20 mg per day in the am.

The medication was doing its job; lowering BP to normal. ,Patient started with a sporadic cough. Any fragrance at all no matter how light the fragrance was would trigger a cough attack. Patient thought it was allergies. It then worsened and she was coughing day and night. She couldn't even sleep. It became so severe she was coughing all the time; when she talked when she ate. It was exhausting and debilitating; the cough was killing her. She then thought it was some lung problem; although she is not a smoker.  She went to the Dr and Dr did a few allergy test and lung x rays.  Well; then finally Dr checked high blood pressure medication.  Yes; of course!!! it was the medication.  She stopped taking it and the cough was completely gone; just like magic.,Patient was taking a low dose of Lisinopril 1 pill a day for slight high blood pressure. She took the medication on and off for 5 years.  She would take it when she felt she needed it.  Sometimes for about 3 months in a row and other times just 1 time a week.

Even though my blood pressure wasn't dangerously high since cardiovascular issues run in my family my doctor wanted me to take this drug because of family history even though I am young.,On the 10 mg dosage I noticed that my throat was itchy and scratchy; causing a lot of cough and some gagging with the cough.  For some reason this problem disappeared when I was switched to the 20 mg dosage.  At times I get a bit of ringing in my ears but it is not regular.  I do notice fatigue and although I have started taking other medications after starting the lisinopril I think the lisinopril did affect my libido; although not a lot.,Mostly pleased with lisinopril because it is effective at keeping my blood pressure down.  Due to a one time mail in problem with my prescription service I was off the lisinopril for approximately a week and my blood pressure went right back up; and was under control again a few days after starting up.  I keep track of my blood pressure at home and it regularly remains in a very good range of 128/60 or so with some variations.  I am hoping not to stay on the drug for long term but since my blood pressure went right back up after a short time of not taking it I'm not sure how short term it may be.

Enough that I stopped taking the Diovan and went back to the higher dose of Verapamil...  I am over 50 and menopausal so weight gain is an issue anyway.  Diovan causes substantial increase in hunger.  Substantial.  Not just an urge to eat but hungry to the point of discomfort.  I tried eating carrots and celery; drinking lots of water and milk; but still I gained weight.  I also lost virtually ALL of my sex drive.  ,Diovan is not taken alone but is in addition to your regular blood pressure medication.  It is taken 1x a day; in the morning; along with your regular med.  The change in blood pressure was immediate; and within days I had to reduce my Verapamil.  But the side effects were so troubling that I quit taking it.

If I was consistent with my dosage; after time if I missed a dose it wouldn't matter.  If I was inconsistent and forgetful with my dosage; I could feel heart palpitations and my bp would rise.  Bringing my weight down also helped greatly.  Typically my bp w/o dosing is 140/90.  At one time; I got it down to 118/80.  Consistency is a key in remembering to take the tablet faithfully every day and at the same time daily.  ,Initially I didn't notice any side effects.  After time; sometimes forgetting to take it; not getting RX refilled in time; chaning RX's; going back to Diovan; etc.; my side effects became more noticeable and I had more of them.  Moderate to sever muscle aches were my major side effect.  Noticed more concentration required during driving; and eye vision blurriness.   ,At first took 80 mg dose; did well for several years.  Over time; weight crept up; wasn't managing stress well and dosage was upped to 160 mg.  Noticed more side effects on that dosage than on the 80 mg dose.  Also caffeine seems to play a major role for me in rising bp; as well as salt causing water retention.

The doctor has recommended that I stay on this product and along with exercise should be highly effective. ,The side effects of Diovan were so minimal I cannot detect them; however; I cannot take the Diovan HCT because it messes up my eletrolytes and I get leg and foot cramps. I try to follow dosage instructions which recommends that this pill be taken at night before going to bed; if possible. ,The treatment with Diovan is very simple. One pill at night before going to bed.The reason for that is most people's blood pressure increases at night and many people die in their sleep at night because of high blood pressure. The problem I have is that the pills get stuck in my throat and I have to eat something like a grape or anything really that will help the pill go down.It does not seem to keep me awake at night which is good.

I thought that my chronic bronchitis had gotten much worse. Then I began to develop bouts of extreme fatigue; anxiety and occasional panic attacks that had nothing to do with COPD. Then I started to have choking fits. They were becoming so serious that I feared choking to death. I suspected Advair; so I tried not taking it and then taking it again. The cause was identified and I stopped taking Advair. The choking fits ceased. The fatigue; anxiety; and panic attacks were found to be a malfunciton of my adrenal gland (confimed by lab tests). The chronic bronchitis improved dramatically.,pulmonologist (also primary care physician) was not much help when I developed side effects; nor did he suggest a substitute treatment when I had to stop using Advair.

The traditional decongestants and anti-histimnies had not worked and I was not aware that this allergy medication would have been so effective. ,It would keep me restless at night causing bouts of sleeplessness. ,Dr Rx recommendation to take 5 mg of Loratadine every 12 hours until symptoms reside.

I was able to use this medicine for allergies but also noticed that my general breathing; especially while working out; also improved.  Years later I was diagnosed with reactive airway disease instead of asthma.  I had noticed I had a much harder time jogging during the seasonal changes until I started taking the Claritin.  Then running became much easier; so it now makes sense to me that the Claritin helped so much.  ,none that I recall - was before claritin became OTC.  I really liked taking the claritin because I had no side effects; unlike some other allergy medicines I had taken earlier; and unlike some OTC I had tried earlier.  When taking the Claritin I felt that I was not really taking anything.  It was just easier to go about my daily routine and enjoy sports a lot more. I have really appreciated how Claritin has helped me.,The treatment details were very simple as far I can remember.  One pill once a day.  I stayed on the Claritin for at least three years.  I do not recall any side effects or problems during this time.  Eventually it seemed as if I didn't have any allergies because I had gotten so used to the positive effects of taking this medication.

None whatsoever. No side effects at all. It does not take me 50 words to explain there were no side effects; but there were no side effects.,Take 1 Claritin tablet every day during allergy season. I take the dose every moring. Again; 1 pill per day each morning during allergy season

The first year or two the patient had to take pills every day due to severity of allergy symptoms; which included runny nose; sneezing; red; watery eyes. Later; when the patient moved to a place without carpeting and with build-in humidifier (same number of cats -3) the outbursts of allergy diminished. Now she takes one pill on a as needed basis; which is approximately 2-3 times a month.

Did not really kick in; but I guess this med. is not supposed to work immediately,I had a dry mouth and my eyes were dry. ,Basically I had allergies and severe allergy seasonal cough. Doctor told me to try Claritin. I only took it once just to see if the drug would work. The drug did not work right away. As it is stated in the label; this drug takes time (perhaps about a week) in order to be effective. I ended up not taking anything. As soon as mid June came around; the allergies and cough that lasted about 3 months all went away.

It helped my nose not to water as much.  However; I still had congestion and some days where my allergies were quite uncomfortable.  It seemed the effects lessened as time went on so the medication was less effective than at the beginning. Also my eyes still itched.  My throat also itched.,I suffered from a dry throat; sore throat; and stuffy nose.  My nose seemed to get too dry.  But it still felt congested.  It just didn't run as much.  Also; my bronchial tubes had a hard time dilating at times and I wheezed.  It did not lessen my asthma symptoms even though I didn't have bouts of asthma on a regular basis. I don't think I had any other side effects. ,I took the pills every morning and night; about twelve hours apart between doses.  the medication did not keep me awake or make me jittery. The medication also did not make me drowsy like some other allergy medications.  The medication; however; did not always relieve my symptoms.  I ultimately tried another medication to see if I could get better results.  I also had to use an inhaler for wheezing since the medication did not help that symptom.

Perhaps an alternative for postpartum depression?  Many mother's feel guilty weening shortly after birth in order to treat their sadness and if Claritin is approved by your MD for use while nursing; why not try it?  Or even as an alternative to conventional depression meds.,It ended my year long depression.,Please see above.

Previously I was treating my eczema with topical corticosteroids like hydrocortisone and fluticasone. I had been using topical steroids for years and had developed cystic acne. After a few courses of antibiotics for acne treatment I realized using antibiotics was pointless if I continue to use topical steroids. I decided to try an anti-histamine which surprisingly helped greatly. Enough so i could discontinue my hydrocortisone. Using loratadine helped my eczema be tolerable but not "cured". I also managed my eczema with a lot of moisturizing.,none; had a period of constipation for a couple of weeks; months after starting loratadine which has ceased currently. It has been 3 months since that time so it could be from something else which I could never pin point,I take 10 mg of a grocery store brand loratadine nightly. I try to not take it with milk; I felt like it was not working the next day when I did take it with milk.

I am not so short tempered and I am able to handle situations that are mentally or emotionally challenging.  I also notice the benefit of not being very emotional. My physician and I decided to wean me down to 20 mg. and when this happened; I noticed an immediate effect.  I was very short tempered and "on edge".  I was also not able to deal with situations that were mentally or emotionally challenging.  I also was very tearful. Needless to say; my physician and I knew I needed to go back on the medication again.,A slightly lowered libido; tiredness in the evening. Also notice I am not as tearful when dealing with emotionally challenging issues; which can have it's pros and cons.,I have been on Prozac for 12 years.  I was titered starting with 20 mg. days; then 40 mg then 60 mg which is my current dose.

My nose cleared up; my sinuses didn't hurt as bad; and my chest was looser. I didn't feel confined in my house.,The side effects were sometimes being tired.  It really didn't affect my day to much; except that I felt better.,I took one pill first thing in the morning.  Within a couple hours; I forgot how rotten i was feeling earlier.  12 hours later; i took another pill. I really could have skipped it; but wanted to help my self sleep better.  So that night I slept the best I have slept in 2 weeks.

All of these worked very well except for Singulair.  Flonase (administered nasally) is particularly effective.

Only during the fall when the ragweed count was exceptionally high (my worst allergy by far); did I feel some mild symptoms of allergies. No other medication has so effectively eliminated my symptoms on a consistent basis.,While taking Zyrtec D I often had dry mouth; and just couldn't drink enough water and was occasionally drowsy.,Take one pill every 12 hours; although on more mild days I could get away with only taking one a day.

I found that prior to taking this medication; I could not sleep and that I was not eating properly.  My overall health was suffering.,It made me so sleepy and sluggish that I could not function properly the next day.  While it did resolve sleep issues; it led to many other issues.,moderate anxiety.

Taking it was like having a few glasses of wine. Driving would have been dangerous.,The medicine was prescribed upon hospital discharge.  Dosage was decreased every two days over six day period.
patient,48,female,Insomnia,worry; anxiety before bedtime,none,Ativan (Lorazepam) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Central-Nervous-System-Depressants Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,1 mg.  taken 1x before bedtime; as needed for sleep for the period of still take it as needed,I have had problems falling asleep for many years. I had tried various other medicines; both over the counter and prescription; and nothing seemed to work - some didn't work at all; some helped me initially fall asleep but woke me up in the middle of the night; and others made me tired and feeling as if I were drugged the next morning. Then one day; my dentist prescribed one Ativan to take before bedtime the night before an extraction; and I actually fell asleep standing up! This is the first sleep medication that helps me initially fall asleep; sleep through the night; and doesn't make me feel tired the next day. Plus; it has the added benefit of helping to reduce my worry; anxiety; and stress that had always kept me from falling asleep before.,One of the warnings on the bottle is "May cause drowsiness". Well; that's why I am taking it! If you don't want to feel drowsy; then Ativan is probably not for you. Another drawback is that if it is used too often; your body will get used to it and you may have to bump up your dose. When I first began taking Ativan; I only needed half a mg. to fall asleep; so I would cut a tablet in half. I only use it 3 or 4 times a month; but even at that dosage; after having used it for several years; I now find I have to take a whole tablet in order for the Ativan to help me sleep.,After having this prescribed to me by my dentist; I knew it was very effective. I'd tried various other medications prescribed by my doctor to help me sleep; so I told him I'd like to try Ativans as they had worked so well as a relaxant before a dental extraction. We worked together to come up with a dosage; and he then prescribed the 1mg. As stated before; the one mg. was more than enough at first; so I would cut the tablets in half and for the first couple years this worked just fine. For the past couple years though; I've had to use the 1mg. before bedtime... and will probably have to talk with my doctor soon about going to a stronger dosage as I am noticing lately that it is not working as well as it once did.

I began having severe anxiety/panic attacks. I stopped the Lorazepam in order to determine the culprit; if any. No panic attacks since stopping the drug. Seems strange since this is the drug of choice for panic attacks. ,Lorazepam was prescribed inability to fall asleep. Also; if needed during the day for anxiety. I never took it during the day for anxiety; only at night to aid in sleep. I have stopped taking it and have not had a panic attack in 2 days.

Another benefit of taking this prescription drug was that it helped me with my anxiety. I have considerably much less anxiety than I did before taking this.,there were no side effects.,1-2; 1 milligram pills per day as needed.

Realized that the drug had severely affected his personality and motivation.  sex drive and pleasure increased with each week off the Ativan.

After Klonopin made me sleepy; I asked for the only other bz he was willing to prescribe;(Ativan);and w/in one week was going through massive w/drawals from the lack of potency of the drug.

The warning label states sex drive may lessen; but with me it increased; quite dramtically actually. Usually one would consider increased sex drive a being good; but with me it was becomming disruptive to my life and the reason why I stopped taking it.

patient,13,male,EXTREMELY SEVERE ANXIETY,Tourette's Syndrome,Abilify; medidate; strattera,Ativan (Lorazepam) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Central-Nervous-System-Depressants Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,0.5 mg to start of at  taken about 2 times a day for the period of just started ,ALL my anxiety; stress; were gone. I also have Tourette's Syndrome; which is a neurological disorder which causes me to have involentary movements and sounds that I have no controll over; (tics.) And once I started taking this medicine; the tics were such at the minimum; i used to have 50-100 tics a day; now i have 3-4 tics all because of Lorazepam. This might be a very good treatment for others with Tourette's Syndrome!!,I feel very tired and i have a hard time focusing in class. But I think once i start getting used to this medication the focusing will come back.,I have been suffering from anxiety for such a long time. I felt as if my life was not living for anymore; but once i started this medicine; everything changed. Even though this is the first day i am taking it; it has done a great and good impact on me today; 4-26-11.
patient,40,female,Anxiety,None,None,Ativan (Lorazepam) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anticonvulsants Antiemetics Benzodiazepines Central-Nervous-System-Depressants Muscle-Relaxants Sedatives-Hypnotics,9,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,1mg  taken once daily before bed for the period of 3 months,Assists with getting to sleep and due to longer half life than other anxiolytics(ie Alprazolam)anxiety is less upon waking. Whilst Alprazolam is extrememly effective for immediate reduction in arousal; I find Lorazepam more effective for overall lowering of anxiety.It has been especially helpful to start the day with little or no anxiety rather than with a high arousal level immediately needing management or medication.,my experience the suggested half life in relation to reducing intake of these drugs is very misleading. Reduction for me has to be done very slowly over a number of weeks not days as usually suggested by physicians.,Taken for anxiety;initially in an acute stage. This was followed by a decision by patient (myself) to continue for 3 months in order to reduce arousal levels whilst undertaking therapy using the theraputic model ACT.

This medicine allowed me to fall asleep quickly and stay sleeping throughout the night.  My doctor told me it was originally marketed for anxiety/depression; but not widely prescribed for that once the sedative effects became known.  (I can't imagine taking one of these in the morning; as a anti-depressant....It would surely knock me out.)  The tablets are sold as 150 mg tablets.  I split mine (75 mg) and for $4 at Target; I get two months worth.  Highly recommend this for those who can't fall or stay asleep.

I felt more relaxed in general and overall; quite happy - in fact; slightly euphoric ( it is a mild antidepressant).  I was able to sleep at least eight hours and waking; I was alert and not sluggish. ,I felt a little unmotivated during the aftgernoons.  Mornings; I was quite peppy but afternoon arrived and I felt sleepy; which is not normal for me.  I also had headaches upon waking up and  felt a bit unfocused.  But overall; it was great!,I started with 25 mg a night; taken right before I wanted to fall asleep.  This worked off and one but not always for my insomnia.  I increased the dosage to 50 mg; which was highly effective.  I took one 50 mg pill.  I felt sluggish in the morning ONLY when I took a pill in the middle of the night; say 3 or 4 in the morning when I couldn't sleep.

I also have dry eyes I believe as a result of taking trazodone and it makes it difficult to wear contacts because of the dryness.

Lucid;vivid dreams. I cut the pill in fourths. A fourth of the pill still helped me sleep but; the wild dreams stopped.,then; When ever my Fibromyalgia flares up... I take it for a week or more and it puts me back on a deep sleep pattern. I don't have to take it all the time. Just when I need it.

Sometimes it didn't make me sleepy and I doubled my dose. It literally made me green with nausea; but I was able to sleep. ,several months drug free; I restarted the medication for insomnia. Immediately my ankles and legs swelled greatly with edema. The water retention and edema is still there even after several days of discontinuing the medication. Maybe this is because I took a high dosage. I plan to go back to my doctor and try something different.

I will lay there and think of thing after thing and cannot "shut down." I originally took ambien for insomia; but my insurance would not fully cover the prescription and it was too expensive to take nightly.  My doctor put me on trazadone as a safe; low cost alternative.  I take 1/3 to 1/2 of a trazadone each night. I vary the dosage; depending on how "excitable" I feel that day. It takes roughly 20 minutes to one half of an hour to take effect.  If I don't go directly to bed after taking it; if I stay up watching tv or reading; when I start to feel the effects I give in and go to bed immediately.  I have got into doing something and fought it off before and sometimes you can overcome it; but another time I accidently took it with my morning vitamines and was not able to go to work.  I had to go back to bed!  I love the drug and since I tend to be high strung anyway; I am sure that I am receiving multiple benefits from trazadone.,I have had none of the side effects listed except for the "may cause drowziness" which is the whole reason I am taking trazadone.,I take 1/3 to 1/2 of a tablet each night about 20 to 30 minutes before going to bed.
patient,63,female,insomnia,anxiety,lorazepam; 5 mg; as needed; but I did not need it during the time I took the Trazedone,Desyrel (Trazodone) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Anti-Anxiety-Agents Antidepressants Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,1,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,12.5 miligrams  (dosage frequency: nightly)  for the period of 6 weeks,I did sleep reliably and without waking up in the middle of the night,gradually got more and more sedated during the day.  I functioned as though my IQ had dropped about 30 points.  It kinda dumbed me down until I was screwing up at work--forgetting details; working slowly; not able to focus; etc.  Also; I became very unassertive--not like me at all. When I realized what was happening; I went off it--and had a significant withdrawal reaction--shaking; extremely anxious; really weird.  The withdrawal reaction subsided in a couple of days.,I was prescribed this drug for insomnia.  My MD told me that it had been used as an anti-depressant; but didn't work well for that; but was good for insomnia.  She originally prescribed 25 mg; and suggested I work up from that if 25 was ineffective.  I am very drug sensitive; so when 25 mg. really knocked me out and I could barely wake up the next day; I cut the pills in half; and that seemed to work--but I just gradually got the effects mentioned above.  I realized later that I had taken the same drug; higher dose; under the name Desyrel when I was 43 for post partum depression.  It didn't work; and it made my blood pressure go down--the number I remember is 77/44.  Same reaction--very sedated; confused; etc.  I would never have taken it; but it was not identified as Desyrel; even on the pharmacy information sheet; so I didn't realize what it was.  The weird thing about this drug (for me) is that it makes me so confused; but subtly; that I can't think clearly enough to realize what is happening until it gets pretty bad.  I know I am very sensitive; and this may be a completely idiosyncratic reaction; but I don't think so.  When I talked to the pharmacist about it she said "Yeah; some people just can't take it."  I know people who take 300 mg a night--and they are fine!.

I was forced to miss work due to a very deep sleep.,I took this ONCE; upon the reccomendation of a doctor. I soon became very dizzy and was forced to go to sleep. When it was time to wake up; I couldn't. Finally I did; but with an annoying headache. Later in the day; I got a chest pain. The side effects of this pill are too great.,Before Bedtime

It is used with many fibromyalgia patients who do not reach the 4th stage of sleep.  With out Trazadone; I have trouble falling asleep; wake numerous times during the night.  Due to this the muscles do not have time to rejuvinate; and I would awake in the morning unable to move - with much achiness and soreness at trigger points thoughout my body..  With out sleep; depression also set in.  Trazadone helps me to sleep helps to illeviate many of the terrible symptoms of Fibromyagia.

Gives more energy to be productive in life. Feel more positive and less inclined to take naps during the day to escape from depression.,extreme tiredness and for this reason must be taken before bed. Also in higher doses which are more effective; it can cause some temporary memory loss. Can be blurry vision immediately after taking drug.,just an everyday for the rest of my life treatment. It is very hard for me to get off the drug and take a break; I immediately feel terrible and then can't sleep.

In addition; I slept through the night with the first two 50 mg pills.,My headaches worsened and I had additonal muscles aches. On 50 mg the first few days; I awoke with horrible facial and jaw pain; I also had some congestion. After going down to 25mg; the facial pain ceased; but I began having nightmares and after the day of elation; I was depressed the day following. I am currently wondering whether these effects will subside and the benefits increase.,Doctor started me on one pill for 3 days;then double for the next and 3 pills upt 150 mg. on the 7th day. I am still at 25 mg. due to side effects above.

It still took me a long time to go to sleep; about two hours.  Some nights it didn't work at all.  When dosage was increased the side effects became unacceptable.  I took the medication for a week and then could not stand it anymore.  It was preferable to go without sleep than to take this drug.,Dizziness; dry mouth; extremely dry skin; highly increased urination; memory problems.,I started with a half pill; then it was increased to 1 due to ineffectiveness.  It was increased to 1 1/2; then 2 pills.

I was not responding to any other anti-depressants and this one sometimes works for people who do not respond to others. Maybe it's because it makes you sleep very well. Sometimes it is prescribed as a mild sleeping pill.,sleepiness; it must be taken at bedtime. and some memory loss. a bit of blurred vision. If there is no food in the stomach there can be nausea. If I get up in the middle of the night I sometimes vomit.,I must take it daily and can not just quit suddenly. I must phase off if necessary.

My balance has been off; I am extremely tired all day; there is a bad taste in my mouth which alters the taste of food. My mouth is so dry that I drink non-stop and cough a lot. What made me decide to quit this drug before the month trial is the fact that I have this really bad memory loss.  I forget where I live; my dog's name; my employees' names.  I would look at a steak and not remember what it was called.  I would stare blankly.  My job is detail oriented and I could not concentrate. ,I am supposed to take 50 mg a day.  I was told to take 1/2 in morning and 1/2 at bedtime or 50 mg at bedtime or 50 mg in the morning.  Whatever works.  There are so many side effects that the good night sleep will have to be given up.  I can't stand a drug taking control of my body.  I hope there is a better treatment.  I have a call into my doctor.

Fluvoxamine is an antidepressant and; as I didn't feel depressed; I was a little dubious initially.  My GP suggested I try it as I was unwilling to take any sedative-type pills.  After the initial start-up period (around two weeks) I found it made a big difference.  I now go to bed and sleep normally without any side effects such as drowsiness.  My GP suggested that I might have had a level of depression which was affecting my sleep; I don't know; although I do feel better generally as well as sleeping well.,In the first couple of weeks I felt a bit upset in my stomach; otherwise I was fine.,I took 100mg  Fluvoxamine about an hour before bed each night.  I continue to take it nightly.

The Luvox stopped all ruminations and obsessive worry; while the generic fluvoxamine seemed to do nothing; and did not help with sleep.,Some vague nausea; which was not a problem with the name brand drug.,generics are better than others; and individual reactions differ.

I found it to be very effective when taken 30min to 1hr prior to public speaking; large social gatherings; dates; and other anxiety provoking situations. It really helps decrease signs of nervousness resulting from the fight-or-flight response; such as increased heart rate; sweaty palms; and dry mouth.,none,as above

It prevents the elevation in heart rate that I normally get; as well as preventing dry mouth; sweaty palms; etc. As a result; I am much more able to focus on the task at hand.,none ,40mg of Inderal generic taken as needed; 1/2 hour before anxiety provoking situations.

Inderal is the most effective medication I have taken to control the tremor. Benzodiazipines were tried early on and were ineffective. ,I have not experienced any side effects from Inderal. At one time I was given a medication for another problem which had hypotension as a side effect. That drug and the blood pressure lowering effect of inderal caused a syncopal episode.,When I first noticed the tremor I was seen by a family practice physician who started me on valium to treat the problem. With the valium I was tremulous and sleepy. I saw a neurologist who diagnosed the problem and started me on a different benzodiazipine. It was also ineffective. I am a R.N. I did some research on my own and ask my family M.D. if I could stop the benzo. and try Inderal. He ordered it and it has been an effective treatment for many years. I only take it when the tremor interfers with activities.

Eliminates the whole butterflies-in-the-stomach feeling; racing heart; sweaty palms and allows you to focus on what your doing and do it properly rather than worry about how nervous you are.,None.,take 3 small tablets and hour before a major speech or presentation (about once a year).  I am thinking about using it for situational anxiety as another user suggested; I had never thought about it as I try to stay as far from drugs as possible and I only use them in extreme situations; but I have missed many networking opportunities because of my anxiety and I think that this drug would have helped.  I have not experienced any side-effects.  I don't think the drug has significantly risky long-term effects.  I think the long-term negative effects of situational anxiety are far worse then the potential risks of inderal.

HOWEVER; IT DID NOT CAUSE ME ANY DIFFICULTIES OR SIDE EFFECTS.  I APPROVED OF THE IDEA OF TAKING THE MEDICATION TO REDUCE MY GENERAL LOW LEVEL ANXIETY AS AN ADDITIONAL TREATMENT TO LOWERING MY HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE. BUT I EXPERIENCED NO IMPROVEMENTS AT THIS DOSE. ,THE IDEA WAS TO HELP WITH ANXIETY AS AN AID TO LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE.  HOWEVER; NEITHER MY BLOOD PRESSURE; WITH ANOTHER MEDICATION; OR THE LEVEL OF ANXIETY WAS REDUCED.  THE LORAZEPAM WAS STOPPED AFTER A WEEK WHEN I COMPLAINED OF INEFFECTIVENESS. I DID NOT EXPERIENCE ANY SIDE EFFECTS WITH THIS MEDICATION.,I WAS TO TAKE THIS MEDICATION ONCE A DAY IN THE MORNING.  WHEN I FELT NO BENEFIT I DISCUSSED IT WITH THE DOCTOR WHO SUGGESTED AN INCREASE OF THE DOSAGE.  I DECLINED.  THE TREATMENT THEORY WAS THAT THE LORAZEPAM WOULD HELP ME WITH ANXIETY AND STRESS WHICH IN TURN WOULD BE AN AID IN ADDITION WITH THE BLOOD PRESSURE MEDICATION TO LOWER MY BLOOD PRESSURE.

During a panic attack my heart would race; I had numbness and tingling in my fingers; and my vision would "grey out" like I was going to pass out. As if that wasn't enough fun I experienced shortness of breath; too. Now when I have a panic attack I take 1/2 of a 1 mg pill and within minutes I am calm and focused.,Mild drowsiness; which is ok if you are somewhere stationary. However; my first attack happened on a busy freeway in rush hour traffic. That is not a great time to be drowsy. But thankfully I only need 1/2 of the pill and so far I haven't had any more attacks while driving.,My doctor prescribed ten 1 mg tablets to take on an as needed basis. The prescription was given to me in February 2008 and I still have 1 left and it's August 2008. So roughly; nine tablets in twenty weeks.

After 7 hours of sleep; I continued to be spaced out and clumsy; bumping into walls and dropping things for another 7 hours.  My mind also felt really slow; stunned and stupid.  These side effects were so strong; my co-workers noticed and were concerned for me.  A week later; I took half a pill to ease my anxiety and help me sleep.  The side effects were less; but still noticeable by others the next day at work.  The last two times I tried ativan; I only took 1/4 of a pill.  It did still ease my anxiety and the side effects were mild; but I decided I'd rather live with the anxiety than live with a mind that felt slow and stupid.,Dissolve one tablet under the tongue at bedtime as needed to a maximum of 3 tablets per week.

My heart rate decreased and I felt slightly less anxious but I still had a feeling of unease especially during social situations. Social situations felt only barely tolerable.  Though symptoms were minimized slightly it wasn't worth the side effects. ,The symptoms I had were one of feeling spacey; dizzy and slightly nauseous and I couldn't take these at work where I felt the most anxiety. These symptoms seemed to last what felt like quite a while at least 2 to 3 hours after taking them but in all honesty most anti anxiety and depression meds have little positive effect. ,Treatment consisted of seeing a psychologist and psychiatrist and all though the psychologist was marginally helpful I eventually turned to meditation and found a lot more relief than through medication and talk therapy.The psychiatrist tried to help me changing dosage and medication every couple of months but I never felt much relief.

I did start Prozac about the same time.,I haven't had any at all; even if I miss a night which is rare. My mornings are slow; but than again I've never been a "morning person".

A combination of other drugs was tried; and they had a limited ability to control the nausea. I had lost a lot of weight; and was at the point where the weight loss had left me pale and weak. When Zofran was added to the list of drugs I was given; I had immediate relief and was able to stop taking several of the other drugs.  I now take Zofran in the morning and evening and have stopped an unwanted weight loss and can enjoy eating again.   I recently had a biopsy where I had to have nothing in my stomach for twelve hours.  The prescribed pain killers after the procedure immediately brought back the vomiting; and my friend reminded the nurse that I usually used Zofran for that.  Within ten minutes after giving me a dose the nausea was gone and I was able to get much needed rest.

patient,45,female,insomnia,none,none,Oxazepam ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Gaba-Modulators Psychotherapeutic-Agents Sedatives-Hypnotics,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,10 mg  taken one per night as needed for the period of on and off over the course of three year,This drug helped me to be able to fall sleep during an extremely stressful period in my life when I simply could not fall asleep.  I had tried many herbal sleep remedies; homeopathics; melatonin supplements; acupuncture and so forth; but the Serax was the only thing that helped me.  Initially during treatment I would be able to sleep 4-6 hours which was a huge benefit to me as I was exhausted from insomnia and stress.  ,Sometimes I would feel a slight tension in my head the next morning; but this was better than total exhaustion from sleeplessness.  More recently I find that on the rare occasions that I use Serax; I wake up with a headache if I take a full capsule.  I find using a half a capsule seems to work fine without giving me a headache.,My doctor tried various antidepressant type sleep medications to help me to sleep but they did not help at all.  They left me feeling groggy and with a strange disconnected feeling.   We also tried Ambien but this only helped me get about 2 hours of sleep and then I'd wake up and feel strange.  The Serax worked for me to help me fall asleep when I couldn't sleep; and to stay asleep for 4-6 hours.  Also there were hardly any side effects except for the slight headache.  I had no trouble going off the medication during the times when I no longer needed it.  Sometimes I would taper from 1 capsule to 1/2 capsule per night; or one night on and one night off the medication; but most times I simply stopped using it when I no longer needed it.   I still use a half a capsule occasionally when I travel if I have trouble falling asleep.

It was a life saver for  me until I got through the emotional upset and was able to detach.,Virtually no side effects; other than very slight drowsiness several hours after taking it...almost not noticeable.,I was on a very small dose.  And I only took this when I felt I needed it.  It was a life saver and kept my body from experiencing intense stress like shaking; heart palpitations; and emotional upset.  It did not change my mood.  It only controlled the negative physical effect that I was allowing this person to have on me.

The anxiety was due to court testimony and memory recall of 5 years prior. Calendar dates were going to be of importance.,There were none whatsoever except the anxiety returned when the drug wore off and when I was anxious my memory recall was negatively affected.,Xanax was prescribed for me because I was a plaintiff in litigation and my accurate testimony was imperative; especially memory recall of specific dates 5 years prior to my testimony. The defense attorney was a rude and nasty old man and was deliberately trying to confuse me to the point of tears. My attorney had warned me beforehand about the defense attorney's tactics so I asked my doctor for a short term tranquilizer. During recesses in my testimony (2 days) I would take a Xanax to keep me focused. It worked like a charm and I won the case. It just seemed to keep me sharp; rather than sedated.

I was worrying that it would occur again at night while alone or sleeping.,I noticed that after taking the drug for several days I became very irritable and short tempered.  The side effects stopped when I stopped taking the drug.  I have never taken it since. I stopped taking the drug after recalling a collegue of mine taking the drug after the death of her mother.  Her mood and personality changed to anger and paranoia as she was taking it for a long time.,After suffering an exreme onset of a rapid heartbeat at work (it started while I was laughing; believe it or not) I saw a cardiologist who determined that there was nothing physically wrong with me; however I started having problems relaxing and sleeping at night for fear the condition would suddenly return without warning while alone or sleeping (I thought it might lead to a heartattack!).  The doctor gave me a prescription for Zanax which helped; but caused the undesireable side effect.  The condition never occured again.

My racing heart rate was decreased; the feeling of panic subsided and the numbness in my arms and legs went away. I was able to eat again; and go about my daily routine.,The only real side effect was that depending on the severity of the attack and the amount I took; as sometimes I cut the pill in half; or if the case was extremely severe; I could take up to 1 mg. was that I got very sleepy. In a lower dose that was not the case but in the higher dosage it did occur.,The treatment details were to take only as needed and it could be taken up to 3X per day; but usually one pill did the trick. I didn't have a set protocol for taking the medication because the attacks were so random; they might not occur for months at a time; or they could happen two days in a row. So; I was told to take it only as needed. I still have a number of pills left from my RX of 30 last year.

Within 20-30 minutes the anxiety would decrease a lot.  Mostly I wouldn't even have a full pill in a day.,If I took the recommended dose (half to a full pill) I would get very tired.  Once I tested different dosages and decreased it to a quarter; I cannot remember any side effects.,The way it was prescribed I was to take up to one pill and I could take it every 4 hours.  That dosage was way to high for me so I decreased it to a quarter of a pill and only took it when I had extreme anxiety.  One bottle of 30 lasted me two years.  I almost never go to the doctor and I never really take drugs unless it is absolutely necessary.  I wanted to do your survey so I could get the free report on making home creams; but I also really like what you are doing!

It became easier to focus on the task at hand without worrying about what was on my to-do list and; due to an eating disorder; how much I had eaten or was going to eat that day.  ,I found it slightly more difficult to drive while under the influence of the drug; and oftentimes I caught myself spacing out.  Sun exposure seemed to strengthen the drug's effect; and being in the sun made me lethargic and sometimes even dizzy.  Overall; I always felt as though I was on an irregular level of consciousness; and not in the same mental place as surrounding people not on the drug. ,I was told to take one or 1/2 tablet approximately 30 minutes before undergoing an event that I predicted would inflict anxiety.  My stress was effectively reduced during family meals and going out to restaurants.  However; I took 1/2 tablet before receiving a vaccination shot and; although I did not pass out as usual; I still became lightheaded and dizzy as a result of the needle.  Perhaps a whole tablet would have eliminated these effects.  In the end; I couldn't get used to feeling like I was on drugs while trying to work; drive; etc. so I decided to not refill my prescription and began seeing my therapist more often instead.

I am one of the few people who has problems with it.  Right before I started taking xanax; I was in and out of the emergency room with heartbeats up to 200 beats per minute.  My heart doctor put me on Lanoxin and inderal to control heartbeat; and gave me Lorazopam for nerves.  The Lorazopam did not do me any good.  I was still having fast heartbeat attacks.  He then referred me to a psychiatrist who put me on Xanax.  My panic attacks stopped for the most part. I started out on .5 mg 3 times per day; and dropped down to .5 mg 1 time per day a few years later; as I was able to cope better with less.   Today; I no longer take any medications at all.  I withdrew from Xanax in 2003.  I am doing fine.  I have gone to a natural approach.

My mind will stay awake forever and I am unable to sleep a minute.  I am groggy if I do not give myself at least eight hours to sleep after I take it.  I feel like I need to up my dose after some time to get myself to sleep.,I take xanax because I work on a morning show so I must sleep when it is still light outside.  Sleeping pills don't seem to work.. Xanaz seems to do the trick.  It calms my mind so I can get to bed and not think about all the things in my life. 
patient,43,female,anxiety,none,none,Xanax (Alprazolam) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Psychotherapeutic-Agents Sedatives-Hypnotics,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,.5  (dosage frequency: everday)  for the period of 1 year,It definitely reducded the anxiety that I had; it also helped with the occaisonal insomnia that I was having. It had a very good effect.,the only side effect that i had was that on occaison it made me groggy the next day but not all the time.,i was prescribed 1 .5mg tablet per day.
patient,42,female,panic attacks,none,none,Xanax (Alprazolam) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Psychotherapeutic-Agents Sedatives-Hypnotics,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,.25mg  taken once a day prn for the period of 2 years,I had severe anxiety attacks and once they would start it was very difficult to decrease their intensity.  My heart beat got as high as 160bpm on two occasions.  I found the .25mg Xanax pills to be very strong so I only would take 1/4 of a pill; which was enough to stop the attack or prevent one if I felt one coming on.  ,The only side effect I experienced with Xanax is sleepiness.  I decreased my dose to 1/4 a pill of a .25mg pill.  I still got sleepy but not as bad.,I took Xanax on a prn basis.  Currently I am not taking it at all.  I was diagnosed with panic disorder and fortunately was perscribed Xanax.  Xanax helped prevent panic attacks and allowed me the opportunity to explore non-medicinal forms of managing the attacks.
patient,38,female,anxiety attacks,none,none,Xanax (Alprazolam) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Psychotherapeutic-Agents Sedatives-Hypnotics,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,.05 mg  taken 1/2 tablet every 8-10 weeks for the period of 2 years,It was calming within a very short time.  At the onset of an attack; just having the medicine on hand was calming. It began to work very quickly after taking it.,It made me a little bit too sleepy.  It also was relaxing to the point that I felt a little disoriented.  It was a great solution as long as I was at home.  It would not have been practical to take when working; driving; etc.,It was prescribed to be taken on an as needed basis.  I would take the tablet at the onset of the attack.  The attacks usually occured at night; shortly after I feel asleep.

I used to have panic attacks at times before I began using this medicine. Now the panic attacks are few and far between. Although I do not like to drive while taking the medicine; if I must I can with no problems. In social situations I am much more myself and can relax and have fun. I have had 3 mini-strokes. Since I began treatment with Xanax I have not had a single episode. ,I have had no side effects from the use of this medicine. When I first started the medication it would make me sleepy. After time this side effect past and I have no problems now. ,Upon treatment I found that results were immediate. I have been told that this drug is highly addictive; however that does not concern me as my Neurologist will keep me on this medicine for the remainder of my life. 
patient,18,female,Insomnia,none,none,Xanax (Alprazolam) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Psychotherapeutic-Agents Sedatives-Hypnotics,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,6 mg  taken when needed for the period of 2 months,I used it for sleep aid as ambien or lunesta never worked for me. I took a half a pill before bed and put me right to sleep. Never had any crazy dreams or sleep-walking episodes. Worked great as a sleep aid.,Sometimes felt a little tired in morning; sometimes groggy. But nothing a latte can't fix.,Took it before bed so I could fall asleep. Never woke up in the middle of the night. 
patient,25,female,Anxiety,none,none,Xanax (Alprazolam) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Psychotherapeutic-Agents Sedatives-Hypnotics,6,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,1-2 mg  taken 1 a month for the period of 6 months,When I am in highly stressful situations; I start to cry.  I took xanax at times when I knew this would happen and it worked perfectly.  I did not cry at all; my eyes didn't even water.  This has never happened with any other medication.,While the drug did give the desired effect; I was groggy and tired.  The worst side effect would be that I had short-term memory loss during when I took it.  I would see notes that I took at the time and not remember writing them and had trouble remembering the details of conversations I had at the time.,Dr. suggested I take a lower dose to decrease the side effects but when I did that; I still cried during the stressful situations.
patient,30,male,Panic Disorder,OCD,Propecia for my hair but have used Zoloft and Paxil,Xanax (Alprazolam) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Psychotherapeutic-Agents Sedatives-Hypnotics,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,.05 mg  taken 5 times a day for the period of 3 years and counting,This simply just works fast and without any of the nasty side effects of SSRI medicines. I won't go into a long story of my panic attacks which I sought help for many years after the fact. This just works and it does what it's supposed to without any annoying side effects. When taken daily; it has stopped my panic attacks from starting and thinking patterns that lead to them. I find it can also be used as needed along with the daily treatment. ,I really don't have any side effects other than the mild but very tolerable issue of taking it 4-5 times a day which isn't an effect but just the way you need to take this. At first; within the first 1 day then couple of weeks after starting; this medicine is broken down by your body fast and you need to adjust your dose. Once I got past the ups and downs of the first week or two of getting this increased from .25 mg - 3 times per day to what I'm on now things are so stable and just smooth. ,I first started taking this at 3 times per day with .25 mg pills. I was advised not to take as needed with my panic attacks as that would reinforce the idea of taking a pill when it's needed and not help me work around my anxiety. This is totally true. At first I wished to only take them as needed but with my doctor's advice; he was right. This really does work when you take it daily at 3-5 times per day. This way your body adjusts to what's going on with the panic and makes no association with taking a pill to prevent or stop it; they just don't start in the first place. Yes; I still do have minor attacks and worry episodes here and there but nothing at all like the many years before this. I wish that this extremely helpful medicine would not have such a bad name in media; news and pharmacies. This works wonders and there is no want or need to take more or become and addict. People and doctor's need to  understand more on how to treat someone with something that just WORKS; rather than trying to give them SSRI's which are what the drugs companies push; all for money reasons. And; the doctor's out there who decide that SSRI's are the only option; they need to go back to medical school! 
patient,38,male,anxiety/depression,dependence,suboxone,Xanax (Alprazolam) ,Anti-Anxiety-Agents Benzodiazepines Gaba-Modulators Psychotherapeutic-Agents Sedatives-Hypnotics,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,.5mg bid  taken twice daily for the period of 2 months,I took alprazolam for 2 months for extreme anxiety/depression. It did work considerably in the beginning; however I would occasionally sleep the day away if taken in the morning. I would wake up from naps with a terrible disposition. It did work considerably for anxiety; initially; but it's very easy to self medicate and take considerably higher dosages then prescribed. In retrospect; I shouldn't have taken the medication because I was already on a medication to come off of opiates; because I have an addictive personality. I discussed this with my Dr. and he told me that alprazolam with suboxone worked well together. I later found out that the two drugs were dangerous to take together because of the potential of respiratory depression. Also; I've found out that benzodiazepines; especially alprazolam can be very addictive; which can have much worse withdrawal than any opiate. I think alprazolam can be a very useful medication if taken as prescribed and only taken on a prn basis. I don't believe there are any instances where alprazolam should be taken twice a day; unless you have signs of extreme anxiety all day; every day. If you have an addictive personality like myself; I think if you consider alprazolam at all; it should be used very judiciously. But exhaust other alternatives to alprazolam; like buspar; which has no addiction potential; however; I think it tends to be pretty much useless unless taken in high dosages. I suggest talking to two or more dr.s before initiating a regimen. I only say this because I know what alprazolam withdrawal entails; and there are VERY unpleasant side effects; which can be life-threatening. Also; alprazolam isn't effective for very long. It is really only good for extreme panic attacks and helps quickly; then it loses its effect within approx. 2 hours. I will also say gladly; that I have known people who have taken alprazolam for several years and only for extreme panic attacks; and none of them have developed a dependency on them. The bottom line is you know you're propensity to addiction. Use your own common sense and if prescribed; have the dr. start you on .25mg.; the lowest dose; and you should see a great difference in your anxiety; especially if your body is not accustomed to benzodiazepines. Best of luck.,lethargy; loss of appetite.,I was started at .5mg; the second strength of dosage; 2 times daily. I became afraid of it because I was taking it to calm me from coming down off opiates; however; I was already on a medication to stop me from taking opiates; which was actually not supposed to be taken with alprazolam because of concerns that both medicines cause respiratory depression.

Normal dosage for Biploar and Panic disorder is 2 mg twice daily; which is a very strong dose.In the first few months that you take it be aware that it makes you extremely tired and on several occasions I have fallen asleep in public places!

Panic attacks were getting under control and I didn't feel druggy or fuzzy headed.,There were no side effects that I noticed at the time. ,Sadly; you can't (or shouldn't) take a drug like Xanax forever. So eventually; after using it for four months; I stopped. OMG. Would someone please explain to me whose brilliant idea it was to create a drug that when you stop taking it; causes the same symptoms that it was designed to alleviate to begin with?!?! I ended up going through even worse panic attacks after stopping the drug than I had to begin with! So in spite of the fact that it worked great to begin with; I would NEVER take this medication again. All in all it turned out to be a terrible experience. There are other far less addictive and nasty drugs available for anxiety.

Seldom experienced middle of the night waking.,Dosages beyond .5 mg. could sometimes cause drowsiness.

It would calm me temporaily but could throw me into depression depending on the situation. If the situation was mildly tramatic the xanax would calm me but then follow by depression. The following day I would have residual sedation. The main complain was the addiction. It was not exactly like a craving but if you did not take it your body would feel like something was missing. It did not hurt but until I took it again I felt not quite content and as soon as I would take the pill my body would feel like it would give a sigh of relief. I think it is as much addiction to the mind as to the body.,As I explained above. Addiction and drowsiness. Your mind and body felt like you were missing something. Until you took the pill you would be anxious but for no reason but as soon as you took the pill your mind would be relived. You would no longer dwell on the anxiety.,Once a day preferably at bedtime but if a situation arose I would have to take another sooner and still one at bedtime in order to sleep.

Really relaxes me and makes me feel much better and lets me sleep. I had major trouble falling asleep before taking this drug. Now I sleep like a baby. Very effective. Taken as prescribed there are no problems. A few idiots abuse this drug and thus the drug has gotten a bad rap unfortunately. Much better than SSRI's with way less side effects. It really makes me feel great. I take the .5 mg fast acting version; not the long acting version. This way it clears my system quicker and I can take it as needed and not worry about tolerance.,None. ,.5 mg/day as needed

It cleared up the infection but I still felt that it was there for a while.  It did get rid of the pain in my ears from the infection really quickly; and the 'blocked up' feeling I had in my ear.,There were no side effects.,The infection was mostly cleared up.  For a few weeks I felt as though I still had a bit of an infection or it was coming back.  But after a while that went away.

After about 3 days on the medication my syptoms were much improved and soon disappeared.  Before taking this medication I would have bouts of this pain every few months during stressful times and it would take weeks to go away.  Since taking this medication during that three week period two years ago I have had no more syptoms of h-pylori despite several stressful time periods.,I don't remember any. (except sensitivity to sun with flagyl),I took these two medications along with flagyl for three weeks; 3 times a day (this is my memory of it).  Fantastic!

I opted not to take a breaod spectrum antibiotic when there was no infection present.  Within 4 days of surgery it was clear that I did have an infection and filled that prescription. I took 500 mg of amoxicillin 3 times daily and took probiotics at least two hours after each dose of antiobiotics to replace the body's good bacteria.  After a few days the infection cleared.  I finished the whole course as directed.

This meant that I was not able to work and had to stay in bed. The effects of the Amoxicillin was almost immediate in that within two hours of taking the drug many of they symptoms had diminished considerably; in particular; breathing was no longer difficult or painful and the fever was reduced. Due to the rapid improvement of my condition following the first few doses of Amoxicillin I was able to return to work almost immediately.,There were no noticable side effects.  For the seven day period that I was taking the Amoxicillin caplets I did not feel 'normal' in that I felt light headed and somewhat disconnected.  However; I was still coughing with the chest infection and it was difficult to tell how much of what I was feeling was due to the infection and its after-effects and how much was due to the Amoxicillin.  My own perception was that the Amoxicillin had no noticable side-effects.,I was prescribed 21 Amoxicillin caplets which were 500mg per dose.  I was instructed to take the medicine at regularly spaced intervals and to complete the prescribed course.  I therefore took one caplet at breakfast at around 8am; one caplet after lunch at around 3pm and one caplet in the evening at around 10pm.  I was not advised to take the Amoxicillin caplets with food and; apart from the first daily dose; the times I took the caplets did not coincide with meals. I swallowed the caplets with water as advised.

Overall taking amoxil was not nearly unpleasant as I thought it would have been and it did the job I was told it would do ,side effects of treatment very rarely occurred and were minimal; however when I did experience side effects they were as follows : nausea; headache; stomach pain; dizziness; and loss of appetite. ,I was told to take 3 500 mg pills a day over the course of a 7 day period in order to completely and effectively banish the infection; I felt comfortable with this decision and it turned out positive results in the end.

(4 -  6 tabs./ 500 mg.)  taken twice daily  for any mandated procedure for the period of Day of any procedure-over several years,Since no such infection (i.e. endocarditis) ever occured after a dental procedure; the logical conclusion is that it was successful as an antidotal/ antibacterial treatment against (i.e.) endocarditis. However; I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years; also with no post-procedural infections.,Sleeplessness; easily bruised; diarrhea: the latter condition remained for up to a year or so AFTER I ceased taking Amoxicillin as a antibacterial antidote. I've not been prescribed/taken it for three years and the symptoms ceased. It's my understanding that this high-dosage; antidotal (dental) protocol is longer recommended.  ,To the best of my recollection (its been a while); the dentist(s) prescribed the 'standard' 2 - 4 500 mg. tablets to be taken 1 hour BEFORE any invasive procedure and the same dosage directly AFTER the procedure: cleaning; extraction; etc.: varying with dentist or procedure. I followed that procedure.

I had two concerns for this oral medication.  First; I was skeptical that this prescription for amoxicillin would be any different in terms of taste and that my son would also throw it up.  Also; being that my son is a diabetic coupled with the fact that he was sick; I was concerned that this medication might have sugars that would affect his blood sugar readings.  I found no real difference in his health for the first two to three days but in the days following; his health improved dramatically to the point where we almost forgot to take it.  Understanding that the antibiotic needed to be taken for the full ten days in order to be the most effective; we continued to take it to the end of the ten days.,My son did not notice/experience any side effects.  There did not seem to be any physical reaction with the drug except that he became better within days.,I gave my son a teaspoon of amoxicillin after each of three meals per day for ten days in total.

I have never seen such a bad diaper rash on either of my babies. I took her in on the 3rd day of treatment and had the medication changed and both of her rashes went away in two days. The rash on her body looked like round welts and they were very itchy. They spread very fast starting as a ring around her whole waist; around her chest and behind her ears. It was blistered.  It also looked like round mosquito bites the size of a dime on her arms and legs. They also lost their appetite. ,This was to treat an ear infection in both ears. The side effects from this medication were way worse than the ear infestion itself. It was extrememly scary to see how this medicine took hold of my 1 year old daughter's body. My son who is 2 was perscribed this medication on Friday due to a bronchial virus; he was also given a shot of antibiotics and given a cough suppressent. The augmenton did not give him the skin rash but he has a horrible diaper rash and it is extremely painful. He is not sleeping very well either and also has diarrhea. He was percribed the medicine on Friday and I didn't realize it was the same medication my daughter had two weeks ago. I will be calling my doctor this morning to explore other options of medication to get him better. This augmenton is bad for my babies. I hope it helps other people. The side effects have definately out weighed the benefits of helping my children heal. I am dissapointed.

In the beginning I was also taking Apri the birth control pill. I took both for a couple of months and my face started to be better in a week or two and completely cleared in a couple of months - which made me so much happier with my life. Then I stop Apri; and I continued with Keflex. And it seems that if I stop Keflex; my acne will come back a little. So I have not tried stoping Keflex for more than a week or two. I am a little concerned with the long term side effects of Keflex although I am not sure whether there should be any. I think I will continue taking Keflex and I will also ask my docotor to test blood or any other things that I should be cautious of. ,It is hard to say. I have chronic headaches and general stress. So I am not sure whether the Keflex may have made matters a bit worse sometimes. Overall; I can't seem to correlate Keflex to my other conditions at all. ,...

(dosage frequency: once a day)  for the period of 2 weeks,I've been taking Duac for 2 weeks; and I've found it considerably effective in reducing and preventing pimples; whiteheads; and blackheads. It is cosmetically appropriate and easy to put make-up over. ,I've had mild dryness/redness was was easily counteracted with a good moisturizer.,I apply duac once a day to clean dry skin and follow with a moisturizer.

Probably my problem was not severe enough to see the results; however; due to no observed change I stopped using it. ,I have not noticed any side effects. Though I am susceptible to various allergies; I have not had any breakouts or worsening effects. Also; blackheads and acne did not become any worse. ,I was prescribed to use 2 cream gels - duac and tazorac. I was using small amount of each: duac as night cream; and tazorac as a day cream. 
patient,30,female,acne,sinusitis,antihistamines,Duac (Clindamycin / Benzoyl Peroxide) ,Anti-Bacterial-Agents topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,6,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,5%  (dosage frequency: 1x daily)  for the period of 6 months,decrease in frequency and severity of acne lesions. Blackheads were not as noticeable and pustules were much reduced in size and number.,Benzoyl peroxide is a strong bleaching agent and ruined many bathtowels and pajamas and bedsheets and pillowcases. During the wintertime; this treatment was mildly irritating to dry or sensitive skin. During the summertime; perspiration tended to cause this product to run off the target area and bleach clothing around the collar or neckline. Some mild dryness and scaling,At bedtime; wash face with mild cleanser. Apply duac gel (pea size); follow with anti-aging over-the-counter moisturizing cream. Wash again in the morning (or else the Duac will bleach clothing); follow with SPF 30 moisturizer; and makeup as needed. Acne lesions which are dry and crusty were treated with a dab of topical neosporin ointment to speed healing.

After about 4 mos my face still gets red sometimes and is a little burny/itchy which it makes it hard to shave.,When I started using Duac (at bedtime) it made my face red; dry; and it peeled.  A great back-to-school look! I play outdoor sports and know I am suppose to wear suncreen but now all suncreens make my face burn(sting) more so I can't tolerate sunscreen.  The slight sunburn is actually less painful.  My acne seemed to heal the first 1-2 weeks and then it flaired up. It still flares but less frequently with less spots and heals faster.  Biggest problem is that it's like bleach on my navy pillowcase and I have ruined a lot of dark colored towels

I did not get a heart infection.  ,I developed shortness of breath and itching all over my body. I had to go to E.R.  There  was also a slight skin redness.,I took the Keflex one hour before my dental appointment. I got my teeth cleaned.  On my way home; I started itching all over my body and developed  a slight rash with reddening.  I also felt like I could not breathe or get enough oxygen. So instead of going home; I went to E.R.  They gave me an injection (I don't remember the name) and told me to use Benadryl at home for a couple days.  If it got worse; the doctor said to return to E.R.

About 10 years later I had severe bladder pain; but no infection was present. After bladder biopsy it was determined that I had intercystial cystitis and the doctor feels it was from being on this antibiotic long term. I suffered with this condition for 6 years and finally had DMSO bladder washes which relieved the problem greatly. To this day I have bladder pain occasionally. ,After suffering numerous bladder infections; it was determined that I needed longterm antibiotic treatment to get the problem under control. Six months of Keflex. Because this was 25 years ago I am not sure of the dosage.

I had a bacterial infection accompanying my flu and there wasnt a single noticeable benefit.,The only good point I suppose is that there was no adverse reaction; such as yeast infection or stomach upset. The downside was the bacterial infection quickly got worse.,Absoutely innefective.  I easily could have been takign a sugar pill for those results.  Bacterial infection became coniderably worse and was later put on another antibiotic to relieve symptoms.

The symptoms took at least 5 out of the seven days to begin to dissipate; which is very slow compared to another antibiotic such as Maxamox. Unfortunately the side effects were more noticeable than the treatment benefits; and the prescribing doctor mistook the side effects for another symptom that was not actually present. ,Swollen glands; especially in breasts. My breasts became enlarged and very painful; causing my doctor to diagnose pregnancy. Of course this was not the case; as I tested negative for pregnancy; and my doctor was reluctant to believe that the Keflex had anything to do with it. My father noted same side effects after a similar course of Keflex. He developed painful and swollen glands in mouth and neck. Also; the management of the URTI took much longer than with other antibiotics. My symptoms seemed to linger on and on.,I had a severe URTI with bronchial coughing; headache;  muscular and joint pains; and general feeling of fatigue. My doctor presecribed Keflex as an antibiotic; she regarded it as a most effective treatment for this severe URTI. I was to take one tablet (I forget the dosage) once a day for a week to ten days. As I was working I had  no time to rest and had to rely on Panamax to held suppress the symptoms. Unfortunately within a day  my breasts became sore and swollen; and at the end of the week I returned to my GP who tried to diagnose pregnancy when there was not the slightest possibility of this. I finished the course of Keflex; only to take on another antibiotic at the end of the course since the Keflex did such a poor job.

It was a good alternative to having a surgical procedure and the required "down time" associated with a surgical procedure.,none,chronic condition - relatively good alternative to a surgical procedure.  Actually; was very afraid of the alternative surgical procedure due to the open wound remaining for a large amount of time and the negative feedback located on the internet associated with the surgical procedure.

It would be helpful if the Patient Education information sheet included commentary about this phenomenon and instructions regarding using yogurt or supplements to prevent digestive difficulties.   ,The Patient Education information sheet mentioned hives and rash as potential side effects when taking this medication.  As a person who is allergic to dyes and food colorings; (a red; itching; burning; eczema like rash results when I ingest these additives) I find it unnecessary that the gel cap in which this medication is contained would have to be colored green or colored at all for that matter.  In order to avoid this unpleasant side effect; I opened each gel cap just prior to taking it; poured the medication out onto a spoon and swallowed it down as quickly as possible.  My surgical results were excellent and I did not experience any symptoms of infection.

The swelling; pain and swollen glands subsided substantially while I was waiting 2 weeks for my appt to have the root canal redone. After the root canal; the dentist put me back on the keflex (2x daily) to insure against further infection; also since I have mitral valve prolapse. After 2 doses I developed diarrhea and took .5mg of immodium (I am sensitive to immodium; only need a very small dose). 8 hours later I developed worse diarrhea and then very severe vomiting; stomach pain; severe headache; dizziness; chills. Also my muscles were shaking and cramping as if I was very cold. I had to be taken to the urgent care; received an injection of phenergan which helped; and told never to take keflex again. Flu test was negative; I had not eaten anything during that day which could have caused food poisoning. Dx: gastroenteritis caused by keflex.

Also; being pregnant my OB/GYN felt more comfortable with me being on Keflex than Augmentin.  The treatment last longer than other antibiotics but seems to be more effective thus far.  No GI effects and no signs of yeast infection like a lot if women experience with antibiotics.

He prescribed Levaquin for 10 days.  I only took one tablet and within 2 hours I felt very lightheaded and nauseaus.  I actually had to lay down and have someone call the doctor for me.  They told me to quit taking it and put me on Cefadroxil (generic for Duricef) instead.  I tolerated that fine.  Levaquin is a very expensive antibiotic and now I'm stuck with the cost of that.  They should just give it out in 1-2 tablet doses first to see if you can tolerate it before you get a full 10 day supply.

I could not shake it; so my doctor - after using Augmentin and Septra; put me on Levaquin. The first course went well; with rapid resolution of my symptoms; but a few weeks later when the symptoms returned and I was given a second course of Levaquin; I began to have joint aches and pains which I attributed to my illness. By day 3 I could not rise from a chair. Both my mother and a close friend have had bad side effects as well.

By day three it was becoming an issue when sitting down and getting up; to the point where I thought I might rupture the achilles tendon. I had never had any issues in my lower legs before. By day four I was having a lot of trouble walking and could only shuffle around. I stopped taking the drug and requested a different antibiotic. On reading up on it; I discovered I it should never have been prescribed for me - I am 61 years old and being treated with corticosteroids for RA. It was prescribed by the ER Physician and my Family Doctor. ,I stopped taking the drug after 4 days. It took me 6-8 weeks to be able to walk normally again. In the 3rd week we had plans to go to a wedding out of the country; and I required wheelchair assistance at the three aiports we went through to get there. I would have missed my flights if I had had to walk.

Actually ; I started feel worse about day 3 or 4.  The drug seemed to be enhancing the sinusitus symptoms!,The treatment side effects of Levaquin were very similar to my sinusitis symptoms; hence the fact I stayed on the drug for several days.  Side effects included headache; dizziness; lightheadedness and nausea (nausea is not a symptom of sinusitus that I ever experienced before).  The side effects slowly got worse the longer I took the drug.,I asked for the drug in liquid form; as I have difficulty swallowing many pills.  I took the drug as recommended; but the symptoms did not get better.  As I mentioned earlier; the symptoms got worse.  I called my doctor's office on the third day and was told that the symptoms I was experiencing was the infection.  By day 5 I knew it was the drug; and stopped taking it.  After a couple of days the nausea went away; and eventually the sinusitus infection slowly got better.  I will never take Levaquin again!

patient,26,female,Cystic Acne,None,just vitamin supplements,Minocin (Minocycline) ,Anti-Bacterial-Agents Anti-Infectives-Systemic Tetracyclines,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,50 MG  taken twice a day for the period of About 4 years,My cystic acne was reduced. My face did clear up consistently with the help of the pills and creams such as retin-a.,I needed to take the pills with lots of water; so I was always taking trips to the bathroom. I was on this pill for a long time; and I dont know if the constant ringing of my ears was a side effect; I did visit an ear doctor for this problem I thought was tinnitus but the doctor assured me the minocin had nothing to do with it. The ringing of the ears continued for about a year after I stopped taking minocycline. Occasionally I still get a ringing of the years; it can be sudden but lasts for a second or so...I was never diagnosed with tinnutus; but the ringing did lessen until it left after i stopped the pills.,I was to take the pills twice a day with water. I took one in the morning after I ate; and one at night with plenty of water....after a year my body became resistant to the pill and stopped working; and i started taking higher doses without my doctors consent..which was wrong of me and dangerous and maybe that is why the ringing of my ears began...but I was obssessed with clearing up my acne. I was young; I believe i was 17 or eighteen when i started minocin and was on and off it for about 4 years.
patient,30,female,Acne,Hair loss & tonsil stones,None,Minocin (Minocycline) ,Anti-Bacterial-Agents Anti-Infectives-Systemic Tetracyclines,7,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,100 mg  taken 2x per day for the period of 3 months,I have been struggling with adult acne. A dermatologist prescribes the Minocycline and for the first two months; it worked great. I had perfectly clear skin AND I noticed that my hair STOPPED falling out at it's normal rate. All the women in my family start losing their hair starting in their thirties and by the time they are 60; wigs are definitely in order. Also; I normally get tonsil stones. These also ceased.,No major side effects other than it stopped working for my acne after two months so I stopped taking it.  The acne has become worse than ever.  The hair loss returned although at a somewhat diminished rate than pre-Minocycline. The one remaining benefit is that the tonsil stones have not returned. It has been approximately one month since I discontinues use of the antibiotic.,Originally; the dermatologist prescribed that I take the antibiotic for two months. I finished the course and the acne started to come back. At that time; I went to see my GP and she said; "If it's working; keep taking it for up to the next 6 mos. to a year." Against my better judgment; I took the Minocycline for another two months. The efficacy obviously diminished over time and did not solve the root problem; whatever it may be.

It took about 2 months for the drug to become conciderably effective though.  ,There were no side effects associated with the drug. The doctor mentioned it would make birth control ineffective but had no confirmation of that.,Face and body cleared up conciderably.  It did take a while for the drug to take effect - but was worth it in the end.  I am now pregnant and will continue treatments after I have the baby.  Once I stopped taking it before I got pregnant - my face began to break out again. So you really have to continue to take it to keep the benefits.

The medication stated to take with food; but on those occasions that food wasn't taken; there was no stomach upset or other adverse effects.  ,Take 1 tablet by mouth 2x day or after 6 weeks; reduce dosage to 1xday.

Then I had the swollen lips reaction and stopped taking the drug.

I have been taking Tetracycline for over 2 years without no result; frustrated; my doctor prescribed Minocyline. After 1 year; I was still having break out just not as bad.  ,The treatment had no side effect on me.,I don't have severe acne problem; just occasional break out.  I was prescribed Minocycline by my doctor and was advised to take it once a day for treatment of my acne.  I was told that it would take up to six month to see result.  After more than a year being on it; it did very little for me.  I was still breaking out; it just that some of my break out was not as bad.  Bottom line; I was not satisfied because it did not help clear up my acne altogether.

I stayed on this drug for several years; along with using topical medications.  I was using so many prescriptions that I don't really know which if any of them helped.  I always still had some acne during this treatment.,Chronic yeast infections leading to daily use of nystatin; yogurt; suppliments; etc.  Especially since treatment spanned high school and college years; the effect of having recurring yeast infections was particularly worrisome.  I also did not know when I was prescribed nystatin to deal with the yeast infections from minocycline that the nystatin could have negative long-term effects on my liver.,During my teens; I took minocycline several times a day for many years.  I was also using various topical medications; and at some point; also took different antibiotics such as Bactrim.  Nothing really worked.  I was also trying suppliments; teas; meditation; changes to my diet and exercise routine in order to try to get rid of my acne.  Eventually I wound up using Accutane which also did not work for me.

The physician increased the dose to hopefully increase the benefits; as I still had significant acne.,After taking this medication for 1 week; I experienced sudden severe joint pain and stiffness; almost like very bad arthritis. I was 30 years old at the time. ,I took this medication as prescribed by a dermatologist for 1 week at the 100 mg dose before severe side effects started.

Lethargy; lack of concentration.,My acne/ rosacea began at age 14; and was treated only topically with harsh over the counter products; with poor result. I began taking high doses of Tetracyclean at age 20. By age 30 I was also adding clindamycin topical solution to help control or dry out the breakouts. Even so; this combined effort was only mildly effective. I never drank alcohol; caffeine; and avoided spicy food while drinking lots of water and having a healthy lifestyle. By age 38; I was introduced to Minocyclean which was immediately effective and controlled my acne/ rosacea. Within 4-5 years; my teeth began to grey; weight gain began; and severe bruising developed on my upper and lower legs. Two weeks ago I phased out of the Minocycline and adopted a strong Probiotic ( 15 billion mc of acidophilus; etc. ) regimen with additional herbal supplement to treat yeast and parasites. I continue to use the topical Clindamycin; and so far the result is very controlled and manageable skin. I am monitoring my teeth and anxious to see if the bruising disappears before long. Antibiotics use create yeast in our bodies; which Acne and Rosacea thrive on. Rid yourself of the drugs; and use the natural supplements instead; and eliminate irritating triggers. Been on antibiotics for 24 years; and now excited to see something finally able to free my from those drugs. The supplement can be found on CandidaFreedom. They also make a natural face soap with the same ingredients. Get off those horrible drugs and at least try it. Give yourself a month !

I have far fewer hormonal breakouts around my chin and my skin seems generally less congested with fewer blackheads.  I have also noticed a reducation in oil on the surface of my skin. ,This product has made me more sensitive to the sun.

However; this one didn't quite so much. It still kept my acne at bay; and worked.,I still got yeast infections; however; they were not as bad and easier to get rid of than with the 75mg anitbiotic. ,I took a 75 mg antibiotic for acne for about a year; then; because it was giving me bad yeast infections; my derm switched  me to Oracea. I got a card with the prescription that made it FREE with my insurance!!

This is a low dose tetracycline antibiotic; so you should avoid the sunlight and tanning beds while taking it.  It's typical side effects are the same as any antibiotic.,I took the prescribed dose for 6 months(even though my dermatologist said I could stay on it indefinitely). The rash disappeared within 1-2 weeks.I was very pleased with the medication.  It has been 1 1/2 years since my breakout and so far I have not had the rash return.

Ease of use over creams; etc.,none,1 pill every morning at least one hour before eating.  Topical medications were a hassle to use consistently; were seldom "cosmetically elegant"; and did very little to keep symptoms from escalating.  Dermatologist prescribed Oracea when it became obvious the the topicals were never going to control the pustules.  Oracea cleared it up in a couple of weeks and gave consistent results throughout treatment - Rosacea was practically forgotten about - with no side effects.  Several months after discontinuing use; pustles have returned but are nothing like before treatment and are manageable with OTC topicals.  Expensive but Oracea does offer discounts worth looking into.

For approximately one week after discontinuing use. I used in conjunction with topical Finacea; which I applied twice a day; also prescribed for rosacea. ,None noticed though per the treatment details (see below) it was often difficult to take based on your eating schedule. ,Take one pill a day. Must take one hour befor eating or two hours after with plenty of water. Also need to avoid sunlight while on this product though that is a good recommendation for skincare regardless of medication.

Strangely enough; it was only after coming off of antibiotics that I developed deep cystic acne. Before I had many small papules/pustules; but they were never very deep. After the antibiotics; the number I would have on my face at one time decreased; but I developed cysts deep under the surface of the skin that would sit there for weeks (never happened before). ,Eventually stopped taking Oracea because of the yeast infections. The long-term use of this and other antibiotics seems to have affected my immune system negatively.

I then stopped taking Oracea. It made me feel like my body was falling apart; the back pain; nausea; and flu like symptoms weren't worth having an acne-free face.,I took one pill per day for 2-3 weeks.

It took about a month to see dramatic results; but some results were visible within a few days of starting the medication.,I didn't experience any side effects until about four weeks into treatment; at which time I began breaking out in very mild hives.  They were so mild; in fact; that I originally thought they may have been caused by a lotion or cosmetic that had gotten on my skin; or maybe by something I had eaten.  The hives would come and go throughout the day; appearing very sparsely on my face; neck; and/or hands.  A few days passed; and I realized that they must have been caused by the drug; so I stopped taking it and the hives went away after a day or so.  I want to stress that these hives were very mild.  I have had allergic reactions to drugs in the past (which may have made be more susceptible this time) and every previous experience I've had with drug-related hives has been much; much worse and possibly life-threatening if not treated.  Perhaps that would have been the case with these as well if I had continued taking the drug; but they didn't seem to be particularly alarming; just mildly annoying.,I took one pill every morning at the same time each day.

All acne was reduced. I think during this first month though is when I started to build up reactors and an allergy to this medication.,I went back to my dermatologist who recommended I take a stronger dosage which is when I took th 90 mg. After about 4 or 5 days I broke out in huge welts of hives. Very severe. I went to the urgent care unit and they prescribed me with steroids and zantac. The next day it just kept getting worse. My whole face itched then my lips got puffy over night. My arms are peeling and are swollen with hives. It spread throughout my body and with all the benedryl and steroids and zantac I've been taking; nothing seems to help! It's extremely irritating and I am miserable.,I am going to see the doctors again today because there is no improvement whatsoever.

This was very convenient and easy to remember. It can be taken with or without food. The Solodyn seemed to reduce the number of inflammatory lesions; and reduced irritation and itching was considerably. ,After a couple of weeks; the Solodyn produced heartburn and nausea. This was very uncomfortable; enough to disturb sleep at night. Solodyn also makes skin sensitive to the sun; so I had to remember to apply sunscreen every day; with at least a moderate SPF (SPF 30+). Healing and resolution of the folliculitis seemed slow; taking months.,I took one Solodyn each day. I also washed my hair and scalp with Clobex shampoo; and applied Mupirocin ointment directly to the lesions.

It became much oilier and I started having large acne lesions again around my chin.  This was especially true before a period or when I was under stress at work.  I decided to see a dermatologist as I was sick of the acne.  I started Yaz which was alright; as well as Retin-A.  This didn't seem to address the larger lesions so my dr. prescribed Solodyn.  Looking back now; I think the side-effect started in the first couple weeks; I just didn't identify them as related to the drug.  I thought I was suffering from carpal tunnel at work and could explain why my knees hurt so much.  I was just about to go to an orthopod when I decided to investigate the Solodyn more.  I read about the joint pain and Lupus-like symptoms; stopped the drug immediately and called my dr. to get in and see her.  She did some bloodwork and I had a positive ANA blood result (mid-positive; not low).  This is one indicator of lupus.  My dermatologist was adamant that the symptoms would go away now.  I called the office again a week later as I was still having strong side effects and was pretty worried.  I got a phone call back that basically said "hello; hypochondriac; you do not have lupus."  Then my eye pain started and my eye turned totally red.  I went to my GP who referred me to an opthalmologist who diagnosed iritis and I started 7 weeks of drops.  She also referred me to a rheumatologist who ran a number of tests and told me she's seen minocycline drugs do this to people a lot and she would never take one or have her children take one - great.  That's my saga.  Now dealing with another iritis flair up and a lot of pain in my left knee; 4 months after stopping the drug.  Please don't take this drug!!! ,After I turned 38 my skin changed.

In fact; my skin was worse. I've taken other antibiotics in the past and they were much more effective at clearing up my skin.  So I stopped taking the Solodyn.,I haven't taken Solodyn now for a week and I am experiencing very itchy skin; achy joints; and fatigue.  The itchy skin is mostly on my scalp and neck. Today I had itchy hives on my leg as well.  The joint pain is mostly in my right hand and wrist. It hurts to make a fist and then open my hand back up. I've had allergic reactions to other meds before; but they would stop when I stopped the medicine.  For some reason; these nasty side effects are lingering.,none

My husband and 13 year old daughter also take this without any side effects.,The first day; you take 2 pills and then for the next four days you take 1 pill.  The packaging is excellent and tells you exactly what pills to take and when to take them.  As previously stated; no one in my family has experienced any side effects from taking this medication.  We have taken both the Z-pak and the generic form.  It works incredibly fast and has saved us from many vacation disasters!
patient,40,female,sinus infection,none,none,Zmax (Azithromycin) ,Anti-Bacterial-Agents Anti-Infectives-Systemic Urinary-Tract-Agents,5,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,one time dose  (dosage frequency: once)  for the period of once- one day,The sinus infection lessened but did not go away.

Both times the doctor did not want to prescribe antibiotics; however; I had had one case of bacterial tonsillitis several years ago and I knew that amoxicillin did not cure it. I requested a stronger antibiotic than amoxicillin. The doctor would not prescribe it. After several days of excruciating pain plus Tylenol with Codeine I begged for a stronger antibiotic. When Z-pak was prescribed; the antibiotic began taking effect in just a few hours. In 24 hours my symptoms were greatly reduced and the tonsillitis was cured in just a few more days.

Although I didn't miss any dose times; if I had; the directions state to take the missed dose; unless it is almost time for the next dose time which would be the following day after the missed dose.  If the latter being so; then one should wait for the next dosage.   ,I've experienced no side effects with this medication as in opposition to some others which have given me problems; especially stomach discomfort/upset.  I do usually follow-up with yogurt or another form of pro-biotic after prescription antibiotics.   ,Take 2 tablets the first day by mouth; then; one tablet on days 2-5.  Don't take medicine within one hour before or two hours after aluminum or a magnesium-containing antacid.  Finish all of the medication; even if symptoms of the illness disappear prior to full prescription time demands in length.  Store medicine @ room temperature; away from heat and light.  Medicine may cause sensitivity to sun; avoid exposure to sun.  Notify physician if swelling; rash or hives; breathing difficulties become present.  Do not do anything that could be dangerous (Ex:  driving; operating machinery) until you know how this medicine will affect you.

Was also taking Cipro to cure a UTI.,Severe diarrhea the first day and moderate the second. Felt nausea and had a hard time keeping food down. Stomach pains and a headache.,Took four 250 mg pills at once; so 1;000 mgs all together. Quite a hefty dose on my stomach but it worked.

As each day passed the infection lessened as did the mucus production. By the 4th day I was feeling almost completely better.,sleepiness approximately 30 minutes after taking medicine; gas after the first day and for 3 days after course was finished; sun sensitivity,I had a cold for 6 days that would not go away. Thick green mucus from the nose and coughing up green/ grey mucus; low grade fever. My doctor prescribed Azithromycin for the sinus/ lung infection. I took 2 pills the first day and then 1 pill for the next 4 days. On the second day I felt halfway better; fever and aches gone. Mucus became more yellow than green and had a reduction of symptoms. By the 3rd day; nasal mucus was yellow and was coughing much less. By the 4th day I felt much better; nose still producing mucus and slight coughing; but no longer as much production of mucus. By day 5; I had no color to mucus and felt like lungs were pretty much clearing out; nose still a little runny. 
patient,32,female,Strep throat,n/a,none,Zmax (Azithromycin) ,Anti-Bacterial-Agents Anti-Infectives-Systemic Urinary-Tract-Agents,1,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,250 mg- 2 pills day 1 then 1 pill/day  taken 2 pills on day 1 for the period of 2 pills on day 1 only,Antibiotic seemed to work quickly.  My throat felt better within hours of taking the first pill.,Horrible; painful diarrhea after 4 hours of taking each pill I took on day one.  ,Seems like a powerful antibiotic that works but it's just too powerful for my system and not worth the side effect.  
patient,37,female,fever blisters,none,none,Zovirax (Acyclovir) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Infectives-Systemic Antiviral-Agents Antiviral-Agents Nucleoside-Analogs Nucleoside-Analogs,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,1600 mg  taken twice daily for the period of 1 day,If I took the Zovirax at the first sign of tingling it would prevent an outbreak.  If I waited I would still get blisters but they would only last 2-3 days.,no side effects,I take 2 pills first thing and then another 2 before bed.

I know you might think; "Maybe there wasn't really one in the first place." But if you get cold sores regularly; you know. Sometimes if I couldn't get to the pills right away and a cold sore did appear; I would take a total of 4-5 pills in the course of the next 24 hours; and the sores would often be gone within 2 days instead of the usual 10. If you can't get to the pills within the first 24 hours; there is really not much good they can do after that; from my experience. This drug is kind of expensive--if I recall from before I had insurance; it was $50-75 for a bottle of Zovirax; but now they have a generic form so it is probably less. Regardless; this drug is worth its weight in gold.

The sooner the application after the first symptom (usually tingling) the more effective.  As I stated still had the outbreak but the ointment did lessen the severity and duration.
patient,38,female,severe cold sores,None,None,Zovirax (Acyclovir) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Infectives-Systemic Antiviral-Agents Antiviral-Agents Nucleoside-Analogs Nucleoside-Analogs,8,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,200mg  taken 5 times per day for the period of 5 days,Severe symptoms of cold sores around the mouth were reduced and cleared up within 5 days.,There didn't seem to be any noticeable side effects.,Having suffered from recurrent severe cold sores in the past; I began taking 200mg  five times a day once the onset of another attack became obvious. Instead of ending up with large and unsightly blisters and scabs; these were considerably reduced in size and the time it took to heal completely was also reduced.
patient,30,female,Allergies,None,None,Zovirax (Acyclovir) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Infectives-Systemic Antiviral-Agents Antiviral-Agents Nucleoside-Analogs Nucleoside-Analogs,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,1 g  (dosage frequency: 2-3 times a day)  for the period of 2 days,Zovirax is a highly effective treatment of cold sores.  I take it in significantly higher dosages than the package indicates and 70% of the time; the cold sore diseappear within a day.,I have never experienced any side effects,I basically take at least 5 200 mg tablets.  I have not found the ointment to be effective at all; only the tablets.
patient,46,female,Cold sores/ herpes I,kidney scarring; chronic anemia,none,Zovirax (Acyclovir) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Infectives-Systemic Antiviral-Agents Antiviral-Agents Nucleoside-Analogs Nucleoside-Analogs,5,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1600 Mg per day  taken 4 times per day (400mg tablets) for the period of over one yar,For awhile it did prevent cold sores. Then I started having frequent chest pains as well as fainting spells. Now I'm finding out from an ER Physician and the Pharmacist I 1. should never have been prescribed this dosage (twice what should be prescribed in per day) and NO-ONE should take Acyclovir for this length of time either. I've been told this is the reason for my fainting spells; chest pain; low blood pressure problems; increased kidney (renal) damage; yeast infections and most recently a series of fungal infections. ,fainting spells; chest pain; low blood pressure; further kidney damage; infections followed up with fungal infections. I now am taking 1000 mg of L-Lysiene (natural food store or grocery store) per day. It's extrememly low cost and it's very effective.,I hope this information will help someone not go through what I've gone through. I don't have chest pain since I've quit using it after one week. I was never even given one liver functioning test on this at all and that is reccommended by the way. Good Luck and take care.
patient,57,female,Herpes zoster,none ,none,Zovirax (Acyclovir) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Infectives-Systemic Antiviral-Agents Antiviral-Agents Nucleoside-Analogs Nucleoside-Analogs,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,400  every 8 hours=1200 in 24 hours  (dosage frequency: 3 days; once a year now)  for the period of 5 years; with good results,I have had Herpes Zoster or VZV all my life. Acyclovir completely eliminates the headache and flu like symptoms. If I take it early enough it stops all outbreaks in one or two days. If taken late; I need a higher dose and it can eliminate blisters in 2 or three days. My outbreaks were once or twice a year and I only used acyclovir cream. Now it appears less than once a year and can be stopped with Zovirax(Acyclovir).,I get sleepy and buzzy headed. No other side effects from the medicine.,don't have any medical insurance and I buy all my medicine at In House pharmacy online.

patient,25,male,herpes,none,none,Zovirax (Acyclovir) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Infectives-Systemic Antiviral-Agents Antiviral-Agents Nucleoside-Analogs Nucleoside-Analogs,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,800mg  taken 3 times a day for the period of 3 years,WORKED EXTREMELY WELL AT PREVENTING OUT BREAKS. an out break would come on and id start taking it and it would be gone withing 48 hours if i took it properly.,massive amount of hair loss. I basically went from a full head of hair to half bald in a span of 3 years.Also arthritis type pain between joints if you take too much for too long. Sometimes i had to lay off of it for a few weeks to regain my strength. This stuff has some serious side effects. Men feel the side effects much worse then woman do.,make sure your doctor prescribes you 800 mg because its wayy cheaper because you can cut them in half if you want because they are tablets. Its like the same price as the 200 mg for the same count so its really stupid to get the lower dose when you can just cut up the higher dose.

In fact; it has completely eliminated flare ups for over 5 years. Before I started taking it; I would get a cold sore once or twice a year. It is very important to have a dose available at all times; because it is crucial to start taking it at the first sign of tingling. The effectiveness of this drug has far exceeded my expectations. ,None.,is very important to begin treatment immediately. Hours can make a difference; once the blister has formed; its probably too late and you will have to go through the scabbing and healing process. However; I have found that if treatment is started immediately at first sign of tingling; the blister is prevented altogether. At least; that is my personal experience.

He ended up on another antibiotic that worked well.,He's one year old; and his mood changed drastically.  He became agressive and mean.  Clenching his fists; growling; hitting his sister and pulling her hair and being totally uncooperative were our everyday behaviors.  He is normally a laid back; sweet child.  The pediatrition disagrees and says it wasn't the medicine; but I know it was.  ,He was supposed to take it for 10 days; but the behavior was out of control; so the pediatrition told me to stop it for 24 hours and see if the behavior changed.  I stopped on day 7 and within 18 hours; he started to improve- within 24 hours he was almost back to normal.  The pediatrition and pharmacist both say that it doesn't go to the brain; and therefore can't cause behavior changes; but SOMETHING in that drug definitely effected him.  I know my child and I watched him very carefully; I KNOW it was the antibiotic.  I won't be using it again for either of my children.

The terbinafine 250mg tablets were taken; 1 per day; for a little over 2 months. The first symptoms of the rash were noticed as slight; itchy redness on the skin around the chest and stomach area. These symptoms were noticed on 5/21; about 7 weeks into the treatment; but the condition not diagnosed as an allergic reaction until 6/10. By that time it had spread to 70% of the body; on the torso; back; and legs. The diagnosing physician suspected the terbinafine; and the patient immediately stopped taking the drug. Assessment of the original condition (toenail fungus) was that the terbinafine had already successfully resolved it.

I cant wait for the nail to grow  back all the way to where I can pick up a piece of thin paper with my fingernail; as I work at an office!.Also; the little black splinters under my thumb nail are starting to go away; as is the yellowing and thickness of the nail; due to the infection.  ,A long time ago; 10 years; when I was prescribed lamisil by my doctor; I had dark circles under my eyes and was tired lots of time. When I went back to teh doctor he told me he had to take me off the lamisil because it was harming my liver function. But by that time; the effect of teh medicine was enough for my nails to grow back after that. I think it was a change in climate; moving away from Astoria to a dryer climate of Portland. ,When I saw the doctor 10 or so years ago; My nails were so bad; it was hard to look at them. The nails were thin and undernieth there was the infection of pus; so much that I had to clip the nails down and even pull one off; which wasnt difficult; because it was so weak; it just came right off. But after I took the lamisil; they grew back better; eventually.

Perhaps a positive effect would have been realized if I was able to continue the treatment,none,I was to take the drug for 12 weeks after having liver function studies performed. I did not experience any untowards side effects having taken the medication for ther prescribed 12 weeks. I did not miss any doses during that time.

I had years of tough; thick; dry; flaky skin on my heel and pads under my toes. As each week passed; this condition continued to improve. Almost from day one I did not experience any itchy toes or feet. At the end of the 90 days; I could see healthy nails growing up from the cuticle; although it will take several more months for the entire toe-nail on each affected toe to grow long enough that I can cut away the damaged nail.,positive side effect was that after the treatment was over I noticed that the skin on my legs was very smooth. Previously I had rough; scaly skin which I just thought was dry skin; though I could never rid myself of it. But I guess it was part of the whole problem because now the skin is beautiful.,the treatment was complete; my doctor suggested that I take one pill every month and use the cream on my feet twice per week.

My prescribing physician told me it would take a full six months of this medication taken daily for it to be effective.  That's not going to work for me.,Total loss of taste and rapidly diminishing sense of smell.  Very bad taste in my mouth.  Feels like I'm sucking on a dirty copper penny all the time.  After one week of enduring the loss of my sense of taste and smell; I stopped taking the medication.  It's only been 2 days and these two senses have not yet returned; but I'm hopeful they will eventually. ,I contacted my pharmacist and she researched the Terbinafine I was taking and told me it could very well be what was causing this problem.  Since I had no idea what else it could be; I stopped taking it on my own.  I then contaced my physician and gave her the details and she agreed that stopping it would be wise at this point.  We are hoping that this is what the problem is and that my sense of taste and smell will return.  We just don't know when it will happen.  Very unpleasant experience; I must say.

I contacted the pharmacy; the drug manufacturer; the FDA and a toxicologist and none were able to tell me how long the side effects would last.

The terinbafine was used in conjunction with applying Nonyx nail gel twice a day.  A thin coating of the nail gel was applied to the entire nail and underneath the nail wherever possible twice a day.  The nails were filed down with an emery board on a weekly basis to scratch up the surface to better allow the nail gel to penetrate.  The underneath of the nails were scraped clean as much as possible on a daily basis.  By the end of the first month ingrown toenail pain was gone.  By the end of the second month; all toenails were noticably less yellow.  By the sixth month; toenails are more than half clear & white; with only the top halves needing to grow out and still showing some yellowness and thickness and curving growth.

My toenails are finally growing out thin and clear.  I didn't start to see any major changes in my toenails until around the two month mark.  I told myself I would be one of the people who comes back to review the product because the positive reviews I read are what got me through those first few weeks when all of the negative side effects were flashing through my head.  It has definitely been worth it to take the pills.  I can't wait for a few more months to go by where my toenails will be completely  be grown out and I will feel confident about going and getting the first pedicure of my life.  Also very much looking forward to sandal season next year.,For the first few days I definitely had some diarrhea but it wasn't that bad.  Maybe some mild stomach cramping within that period too.  But I ate some yogurt with it before I took it at bedtime which helped curb any intestinal issues.  All of this went away within a week or two of taking it.  I also experienced some cotton mouth feeling and that lasted pretty much the whole time.  It wasn't too bad but noticeable.  I never had any taste disturbances.,I took one pill a day; at night for 90 days with a big glass of water and never skipped a dose.

Nausea was constant even when the drug was taken separate from other drugs and with food/on a full stomach etc.  I felt almost flu like; ie the beginning of flu onset when you are not yet fully sick.,When I discontinued use (while still in a Malaria risk area) I relied soley on preventative measures.  I was in a night biting mosquito area (Thailand; Laos and Cambodia) so slept under a mosquito net.  Used mosquito spray in the room and used a special spray for one set of clothing for higher risk environments (ie jungle).  Also spoke with an Asian doctor at length about the Western philosphy vs Eastern for treatment.  His take was that Eastern doctors choose to treat malaria when it is contracted but Western take higher and higher levels of drugs to prevent contraction.  This may lead to drug resistant strains...

By contrast; I was never really bed bound and was out and about after about one week.  I did not experience any longer term effects. ,Slight nausea at times,One table to be taken twice dailyn for five days

One tablet every day for 5 days.  I was disheartened that my health insurance only paid 10 - 15% of the cost of the medication because it was a very expensive mediaction.  Every time I took a pill I felt like I was swallowing a 20 dollar bill.
patient,34,female,flu,fever,none,Tamiflu (Oseltamivir) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Infectives-Systemic Antiviral-Agents Antiviral-Agents Enzyme-Inhibitors Enzyme-Inhibitors,9,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,75 mg  taken twice a day for the period of 5 days,I fastly recovered from the virus and felt much better after the second administration of the drug.,I have not noticed anything special as side effects,The medicine was prescribed to me by my GP as I was in contact with pregnant women by the time and I was afraid that I will transfer the virus to them also.

One daily dosage worked for the entire day.  Even into the evening; if I ate spicy food or chocolate; I could go to bed without experiencing any heart burn.,None that I have encountered.,I have been taking meds for my acid reflux for many years; originally Omeprazole (generic for Prilosec).  However; becaus Omeprazole was not on my insurance drug formulary; I was taking Prilosec OTC.  At my last check-up my doctor prescribed the Prevacid and I like it.  It even tastes like strawberries!
care giver,80,female,acid reflux,none,none,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,4,Marginally Effective,No Side Effects,1  40mg pill daily  taken once daily for the period of once,She did not seem to have much benefit from it.  She still had considerable gas & acid reflux.,No side effects.  Her only complaint was that it did not work as well as she thought it would,She was to take one pill in the morning with the first meal of the day.  No other treatment instructions.
patient,46,female,Severe Heartburn,None,Vitamins,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,7,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,20 MG  taken 2x/day for the period of 1 year,Overall acid reduction; however; it could be sporadic.  With taking the medication; still had to watch diet and avoid triggering foods.  At times; the medication was not effective.,None,Symptoms were so severe they would wake me up in the middle of the night; gasping for breath at times.  This treatment reduced episodes such as this; but was not 100% effective at all times.
patient,23,male,GERD,None ,None related,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,30mg  taken 2x/day for the period of 5 years,Feels like it stops nearly all acid production; heartburn is gone.  Due to cardia weakness stomach contents can still travel up esophagus but no burning sensation is felt.  Regardless there is still some mild irritation in my esophagus.,Nothing noticeable.  Soluble tablet has a slightly unpleasant aftertaste.  Unknown if my vitamin B12 levels have been affected.,Will likely be on Prevacid indefinitely due to GERD unless I have Nissen fundoplication surgery; and perhaps even still then.  Had trouble with coverage under a new insurance company when I changed and I now take the soluble tablet instead of the capsule.  If I discontinue the drug then heartburn returns fully after a couple of days.
patient,57,male,pre-barrett (errosion of the esophagus),GIRD,none,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,30 Mg. once a day  taken once for the period of still taking it,the prevacid allows me to eat and drink certain foods/fluids that I normally could not tolerate anymore without great discomfort i.e. spicy foods; coffee; chocolate; tomato products; and alcholic drinks; which I only drink occassionally such as red wine.  If I skip the prevacid for any reason; I almost certainly will be very uncomfortable.,It seems to give me a tendency to gain weight in the abdomen.  I did try some alternatives; including Nexium; which was not a good substitute at all!  ,I have been on prevacid for approximately 6 years as a a prophylactic against the pre-barretts.  I have tried to slowly come off the drug (it is the only one I use) but I would venture to guess that unless I changed my diet significantly; this is not going to happen.
patient,56,female,acid reflux,none,none,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,5,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,??  (dosage frequency: daily)  for the period of 2 month,Taken daily; Prevacid successfully reduced my acid stomach symptoms to the point that they did not occur. I did not need other over the counter remedies I had used in the past; such as anti-gas and antacid medications taken after symptoms appeared.,Unfortunately; I became woozy and suffered dizziness after taking the medication; often requiring that I lie down and or take a nap. After an initial period of a few hours; these symptoms subsided. Side effects were sporadic and I tried initially to continue the medication due to its effectiveness.,Prevacid was prescribed for my symptoms of acid reflux; which included some stomach  upset and "full" feeling after eating.  Although it was highly effective; I eventually discontinued use of Prevacid due to side effects.  I am now using over the counter Zantac successfully; only as needed; not daily. It should be noted that I am very sensitive to medication and often react to medications that are not a problem for others.
patient,56,female,acid reflux,none,none,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,7,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,??  (dosage frequency: daily)  for the period of 2 month,I suffered from acid reflux symptoms which included mild stomach upset and a full feeling after eating. Prevacid eliminated these symtoms very effectively to the point that I did not need repeated doses of over the counter anti-gas medication and antacids.,Taken daily; Prevacid unfortunately caused severe side effects which included dizziness and a woozy feeling like I was over medicated. The side effects were so severe that I often was unable to work and needed to lie down and occasionally took a nap.,Prior to taking Prevacid; my symptoms required daily doses of anti-gas medications and occasional antacids. Although Prevacid was very effective; I discontinued use of it and switched to over the conter Zantac because of the side effects. As a note; I am very sensitive to medications and often experience side effects from different medications and thus refrain from any unless experiencing severe symptoms.
patient,46,female,Stomach ulcers,None,None,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,15 mg  taken once daily for the period of one year,After approximately two weeks of first using Prevacid; I noticed significant improvement in my symptoms.  Within 2 months; the symptoms had completely been resolved.,No side effects at all.,I began experiencing serious stomach pains and persistant diarrhea.  Friends and family suggested that I had irritable bowel syndrome and I thought I would just have to deal with it.  My symptoms progressed to the point that I was barely eating and had lost a significant amount of weight.  I consulted with a gastroenterologist who performed an endoscopy.  I was diagnosed with multiple stomach ulcers and was prescribed Prevacid 15 mg capsules to take once daily.  Within 2 weeks of taking the medication; I started to notice improvement in my ability to eat certain foods.  Within one month; I could eat practically anything with only an occasional onset of symptoms.  After 2 months; I was no longer having any problems.  My doctor recommended that I continue taking the medication and I did so for approximately one year.  I have had no problems since discontinuing the medication so it definitely resolved the problem.
patient,45,female,heart burn,None,none,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,7,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,30mg  taken once a day for the period of 4 weeks,After a copule of days I started to feel a little better. I did not feel as much tension in my stomach; and the pain started to go away. I have been using it everytime I feel pain in my stomach. I did not have heart burn though. It was only treated for pain/ulcer purposes.,None. I did not feel any side effects whatsoever.The only thing is that it does not work inmediately like other pills. It takes several days for the pill to start working; but it does do the job.,It took several days for the medication to start working; but once it did I felt better. I have to take one pill everyday with food for 4 weeks. 
care giver,2,male,Eosinophilic esophagitis,none,none,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,5,Marginally Effective,Mild Side Effects,1.25 mg  taken 3 times/day for the period of 2 months (ongoing),It is difficult to discern if there were any real treatment benefits.  Our son was given Prevacid after being diagnosed with eosinophilic esophagitis in an attempt to stop frequent bouts of mid-night stomach pain.  It is possible the Prevacid had a mild-moderate impact on his stomach pain but more than likely it was the concurrent dietary modification.,There were no long-term side effects.  The first several evenings his stomach pain seemed to increase so the frequency was reduce to twice daily for the first 2 weeks.,Treatment consisted of Prevacid (1.25 mg) three times a day and at this time the duration is indefinite.  Concurrently his diet was modified; removing wheat; peanuts; dairy and beef; based on a blood based allergy test.  The next phase of evaluation will include a measured DTH response to the identified allergens.

The burning i also began to go away.  it took a full week for everything to return to normal for mw.,While I have been taking the medicaion I have not experience any side effects.  The only thing that bothered me was that it took about 2 dayss to see improvement which was not a long time but when you are uncomfortable it seems much longer.,Went to doctor because of burning and pain in my stomach.  As long as I was consantly full my stomach was better but the second it became empty I was back to being uncomfortable.  I want to get rid of these symptoms before I became over weight so i went to my doctor and he started me on 60 mg for 1 week and then I was changed to 30 mg once a day and after a couple of days I felt much better. and have every since.
patient,50,female,acid reflux,gastroparesis,reglan; stopped due to side effects,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,9,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,30mg 2x daily  taken 2xdaily for the period of still take,I can eat and drink more normally without as much acid reflux and vomitting.  My condition results in slow digestion and intollerance of some foods.  With prevacid; I eat small amounts and avoid irritants.  I have had refluz episodes in my sleep.  With religious use of prevacid; this rarely occurs.  I can eat a larger variety of foods. It has made a positive difference in my quality of life.  ,I have not experienced negative physical side effects that I am aware of.  This drug does not aid with digestion of food.  I still have nausea and vomitting but; not because the drug doesn't work.  My doctor explained my other symptoms result from food in stomach several hours after eating.,I have tried every prescription medication for acid in stomach and had gall bladder removed.  I have modified my diet and avoid irritating foods and drinks.  With prevacid twice daily (normal dosage is once daily) I can eat and drink with less nausea.  Without it; my diet would have to be clear liquids and pulverized solids.  It has made a tremendous positive difference.  I do not want to stop taking it unless something better is approved.  It is not a treatment for the paresis.  Reglan is the only FDA approved prescription drug for my condition that I am aware of.  I cannot use it without horrible side effects.

I recently had a scope of my upper GI and there were no problems.  I think Prevacid keeps me from having any damage to my esophagus.

I take it once daily before breakfast. ,I had no side effects to this drug.,Be sure to remember to take every day before eating your first meal in order for it to work effectively!
patient,76,female,acid reflex,none,Lovasa mg/Levothyroxine,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,5,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,15mg acid reducer  taken morning and night..2 a day for the period of 3 days,supposed to stop acid reflex; which it did for 2 days,congestion and pressure within 2 hours after taking the morning dose on the 3rd day.,I will be taking Omeprazole; as I have been doing for years.. took Prilosec before the generic was available.   Prevacid contains only 15 mg of acid reducer whereas the other two contain 20 mg.  Yet you are charging as much as the others; and giving the customer 25% less.

I also have tried other prescriptions for acid reflux and none have worked for me as well as Prevacid has.,Also; for whatever reason; there also have been times I have had to take 2 pills versus the usual 1 pill. ,One pill once a day. The ingredients are supposed to limit or decrease acid reflux.
patient,67,male,Excess stomach acid.,Crohn's disease in remission.,None,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,15mg per day  taken once per day in the morning before food. for the period of 2 months,Reduced acid production to normal levels.,At prescribed level of 30 mg/day I suffered fatigue and bacterial overgrowth in the stomach. At half this dose I was fine. But; needed dosage levels are different for different people.,The secret of taking proton pump inhibitors and H2 receptor inhibitors lies in finding the right dosage and the right time of day to take it. Zoton Fast Tabs are tablets which dissolve on the tongue and can be broken to alter the dosage. I found that half my prescribed dosage of 30 mgs/day was enough for me and so break the tablet in two. 
patient,82,female,Indigestion,Nothing just  indigestion through the night,gaviscon,Prevacid (Lansoprazole) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,one per day  (dosage frequency: two days)  for the period of Once for two days,This was recommended to me instead of Gaviscon.  Supposedly it was a better solution for my indigestion.  Instead it was a disaster.,Terrible Terrible.   I already suffer from constipation; but I took one of these tablets; as prescribed; for two consecutive days.  After two days I knew they were a no-no for me.  My innards came to a complete STOP. I shall throw the remainder of the tablets away.  Four days on my innards are still at a standstill.,Capsules and me do not get along.

I'm severely allergic to it.,Swelling of the face; tingling; itchy eyes; and tighness of chest/difficulty breathing.,I went to the doctor for back pain. My UTI test came back negative except my leukocites were up. I guess she prescribed this to me to be cautious. I took one dose and ended up in the emergency room within an hour. I am now the proud owner of an epi-pen!

Then my stomach was hurting and I had diarrhea. I decreased the dosage (on my own; which I would not advise others to do) because I have a history of pseudo-membranous colitis; and I need to be cautious of antibiotics. However; I needed the med for the kidney infection. On days 2-5 I took 250mg 3 times a day (eight hrs apart). This reduction in dosage relieved the stomach pain and the diarrhea. After the third day of antibiotics; I noticed a decrease in back pain so I knew the medication was working.
patient,52,female,Chest Infections,Paralysed diaphragm; arthritis,spironolactone; doxycycline,Proquin XR (Ciprofloxacin) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Quinolones Urinary-Tract-Agents,5,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,500mg  taken 3 times per day for the period of 21 days,Reduces the symptoms of pseudomonas chest infection for a few weeks; especially the haemoptysis.,Condiderable nausea; bad dreams & increased sensitivity to the sun.,Take the drug for a 3 week course then wait until symtoms increase again then have another 3 week course. Usually works out at about 3 weeks on & 3 to 4 weeks off.

Stopped coughing up blood. Improvement in chest pain.,Nausea; bad dreams; very prone to sunburn. For the antibiotic to be effective I need to take a relatively large dose for my size (50kgs). Have to take anti-nausea medication while on the course of antibiotic otherwise tend to lose weight.,Have had repeated courses of this antibiotic over several years. Sometimes it works and other times it doesn't but the infection always recurs within a few weeks of stopping the treatment.

The person who previously reviewed had an allergic reaction.  That does NOT mean the drug doesn't work; that means she simply can't tolerate the medication.  ,My father is in a wheelchair.  For those of you with handicapped family and friends; you know how difficult urinary tract infections can be.  Ciprofloxin was a major break through for UTI's.  Unfortunately; paralyzed men and women have trouble holding their bowel movements due to the "dumping" effect of cipro releasing directly into the gut.  Although not widely promoted just know that Proquin XR has truly changed my father's life.  Instead of being hospitalized once a year due to a UTI; he can now take Proquin XR and continue on with his normal daily life/work etc.  Proquin XR basically allows the body to metabolize more of the medication and this in turn makes the medication more efficacious.  In layman's terms; it works faster and more effectively.  If you have digestive issues due to cipro or any antibiotic; you seriously need to try this medication.  It has not only helped my father but has made my family's life much easier.    
patient,61,female,pneumonia,bronchiectasis,none,Proquin XR (Ciprofloxacin) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Quinolones Urinary-Tract-Agents,3,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,250mg  taken 2 x day for the period of 7 days,My cough was reduced; from 24 hours a day; to a few episodes per day,First; what I termed "Cipro brain"; which is not thiking clearly and making mistakes (like jet-lag).  Then; I started getting ulcers on my tongue.  They spread to my gums and inside lips and my tongue was swollen; making it difficult to talk.  I was afraid that if I got stopped; driving; the cop would think I was drunk; because I was slurring my words.  Now; several days after stopping the drug; I still have extreme fatigue. I'm hoping to return to normal!  When I had pneumonia; I actually felt fine; but the cough had to to be treated.  I doubt if I would ever take Ciprofloxacin again. ,I took the pill twice a day; morning and evening; after meals.  I also kept up with my daily exercise regimen (walking and swimming).

Also; I developed other side effects while using the drug; including low-level nausea; loss of appetite and headaches.,I started off on a dose of 1 x 500 mg enteric-coated tabs four times daily (the doctor's recommended test dose to see if I responded negatively to the drug); but when I tried to increase this to 2x 500 mg tabs four times daily after one week; the side effects I had been experiencing increased; so I dropped back. I tried one more time to increase the dose more gradually (2 x 500 mg in the morning; then 1 x 500 mg at lunch; dinner and bedtime); but even this became too unpleasant to put up with (especially since I didn't have these symptoms before I started!). I perservered for 6 weeks; before deciding to taper the dose to zero over a couple of weeks; after which the symptoms disappeared.

I devloped the shingles in the 5th cranial nerve.  I had lesions following the entire nerve roots across my face; but had them internally as well.  There were lesions in the ear canal; the side of my tongue and down my throat.  I had taken a flu shot and had exposure to sun; as well as starting 2 new jobs about the same time as the first onset.  I developed 1 blister which I thought was herpes. I had not had a herpes outbreak in years. I started the acyclovir and noticed more and different complaints every day.  I first got a lesion on the entrance to the ear canal and more accompanying the first one on my lower chin.  Then my lower teeth began to become painful; as if I had a great toothache.  After about 4 days; I began to feel exhausted and unable to snap out of my fatigue.  The next day I awoke and had a sensation that my mouth was not fully moving.  Later the eye began to remain open and would not blink. The 3rd day of these symtoms; I devloped total paralysis of the left face. I saw 1 of my doctors immediately.  He gave me a cortisone shot and told me the dose of acyclovir to take.  He said it was bell's palsey. A friend called and said it was Ramsay-Hunt.  I was on bedrest from Mid October until 2 weeks ago.  I have very little stamina; and slowly I am getting more energy.  The latest addition to my medication arsenal was Alpha-lipoic acid.  I had statrted lysine and red marine algae.  I stopped coffe; soda; most meat and ate only what little I cooked or made myself.  I am pleased that most of my facial functions have returned; with the exception of the eye bliking completely; and a slight difference in my smile.  I take at least 1 dose of ibuprophen every day due to neuralgia or a sense of swelling in my left face.,I did not notice any.,acyclovir; rest.  PRN doses of ibuprophen.

It is recommended by some to take an antiviral for one year after the initial outbreak so as to have less outbreaks over one's lifetime.  I did get an outbreak while on the drug; however it was during a very stressful time so that is understandable.  Also; it is nice that only one dose is needed per day for most people. ,Side effects included mild hair loss (had much more hair loss on acyclovir); random dry heaving (retching) for no apparent reason; and headaches.  Although it seems that when I drink lots of water the headaches are fewer.,Took one pill per day at the same time everyday.  It does and will stain things so be careful of the blue dye.

If i stopped I was garenteed to get one,I was taking them on an empty stomach and developed ulsers and Heart burn; acid reflux,pill form; once a day. But now because of side affects I only take it once a week or when needed.

The second time it was about 1/2 the size. The third time it got red and itchy but it didn't actually blister. The forth time I didn't take the medication because it was only the size of a small pimple. I used to get them about every 4 to 6 weeks but the last one came about 4 months after the previous one. ,No side effects at all.,You take 4 pills as soon as you can tell the cold sore is beginning and then 4 pills 12 hours later.

The medication seemed to shorten the actual outbreak time and lessened the pain and discomfort.

Preventative; if I could catch the coldsore before it broke thru; as well as successful in reducing the length of time and size of the coldsore itself.

So even under stressful life events which usually results with a breakout the Valtrax stopped or reduced the frequency of breakouts. So far I have only been taking 1 per day and I have not had any breakouts for a month.,It initially made me feel tired and lethargic. I believe it contributed to  a short bout of stomach upset and heavy bowel movements however this problem subsided fairly quickly. I think it also contributes to my eyes feeling dryer than usual. Since I am post menopausal dry eyes is a huge problem.,I was supposed to take 2 tablets a day 1 in the morning and 1 in the evening. I followed this regimen for 1 and a half weeks then I decided to reduce the dosage myself to 1 per day. I checked with the ND and she said that protocol could be followed unless I felt that I was going to have a breakout then go back to 2 a day. I can take up to 4 per day if needed however so far the 1 per day has worked well for me.

However; I was forewarned that Valtrex has the following side effects:  headache; gastrointestinal discomfort such as vomiting; nausea; diarrhoea;constipation; abdominal pain;indigestion).  Also because I was taking Valtrex to prevent outbreaks triggered by laser treatments; I was advised that Valtrex causes sensitivity to UV light and my skin would be much more vulnerable to sunburn even during very short exposure to UV light.  ,I took Valtrex before a laser treatment to prevent the outbreak of cold sores or herpes virus.  The first laser treatment without taking Valtrex caused a herpes/cold sores breakout on my face around the chin area.  After consulting with my physician; he prescribed Valtrex to prevent the outbreaks in future laser treatments.  I learned that the laser triggered the herpes outbreak; since the virus is in a dormant state until it is disturbed and activated by the laser.  I was prescribed 500 mg of Valtrex to be taken 3 days before the treatment; the day of the treatment and three days after the treatment; for a total of seven days.  I took the medication twice a day and started this seven day regime each and every time I had a laser treatment to prevent any outbreaks.

In my case; the symptoms were increasingly worse.  I would have an outbreak every two months that would last 14-18 days.  Since treatment; I have not had one outbreak.  Two years and counting.,Fatigue; and possible water retention.  I; nor my doctor monitored water retention or weight gain; but I am fairly self-aware.  The doctor did mention possible fatigue and/or nausea.,Taken as needed when stress levels increase or over-exposure to sun.  
patient,33,female,Facial Herpes Simplex,None,None,Valtrex (Valacyclovir) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Infectives-Systemic Antiviral-Agents Antiviral-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,500 mg twice a day  taken as needed; not regularly for the period of As needed for 6 years,By taking the pills anytime I feel the vaguest possibility that I might be getting a cold sore; I was able to reduce the number of outbreaks. The outbreaks that I do have (if; for example; I don't take the Valtrex in time) seem not as bad as they would be without the Valtrex. The outbreaks seem somehow less... viral. As in; the sores may still form; but the entire process of blistering/opening/scabbing doesn't feel quite as much like my face is a nuclear radiation site. ,None,I get horrible outbreaks in the center of my chin-- usually 5-8 sores clustered together all at once; really awful-looking. I'm aware of the things that trigger them; so when I realize there's a chance I might have an outbreak; even if I haven't felt the tingling yet; I'll take a couple of Valtrex and then I don't have an outbreak at all. I can't say for sure that it's the Valtrex stopping it (i.e. maybe I wouldn't have had an outbreak anyway in some cases) but it seems that way to me; and in any case it's nice to have some sense of control over the situation. Even though my outbreaks are awful; they only happen about 2x/year so I haven't felt it necessary to take the daily preventative pills.

Medication also made the cold sore break out less servere.,Side effects included initial headache until the body got used to the medication.  Some dizziness and nausea was experienced; but minor.,Treatment included medication 2 times a day.  Instructions were to keep the area around the cold sore clean and to not touch the cold sore directly with hands.   This would ensure the spread of the cold sores was minimized.

These would interfere with personal time with my spouse; backpacking trips; day to day comfort.  In the time I have taken Valtrex I have not had one outbreak; and don't have to think about it any longer.,In the first weeks 2-3 I would have frequent low grade headaches; and a generally tired feeling.  But after I got used to the medication I didn't have any side effects.,Took one 500mg pill every morning.  That's it.

If you wait until you have a red lump or blister; the valtrex will speed the healing; but will not eliminate the sore; which may last 7-10 days.

Overall; the healing was much faster; and there were only two pills a day to take (not 2 x 3 times a day; like with old-times Acyclovir); which was convenient,As I have a chronic gastritis; my stomach rarely agrees with oral treatments; so I felt minor irritation; a bit of heartburn; but nothing serious,that; I started taking 2 pills of Valtrex the day I started feeling the outbreak (a nasty; gnawing feeling in the area where the sores would appear) and if it does not prevent the outbreak entirely; it lasts much shorter; is much less painful; and each time the remissions are rather long.

This was about the size of a quarter.  I thought I had some sort of insect bite and just ignored it until it got worse and I felt so tired and sick that I went to the dr.  He took a culture but at that point he didn't think there was anything to test but prescribed Valtrex.  I took it immediately and within a day felt relief.  After a couple of days I felt a million times better.  I have had one or 2 re-occurances over the last 10 years and I make sure I always have Valtrex on hand just in case.  It is a terrible condition and I am thankful for Valtrex as it seems to stop it in its tracks.

If the cold sore has fully surfaced it will still help to speed healing (usually within a week). This medication is not a cure for cold sores.,I have not noticed any side effects and have been taking this drug for a couple of years. It is important to note; there is no cure for cold sores (herpes). I don't know how the drug works but it seems if I am run down over the course of several weeks I may have to take the drug several times to keep a cold sore from surfacing.,When you first feel a cold sore coming on take 4 pills with water; wait 10 to 12 hrs and then take another 4 pills. I have heard of people taking a daily maintenace dose that should ensure you never see a break out of blisters appearing; however; if not on a drug program; this would be very expensive; and depending on how many times you tend to break out; probably not necessary.

The outbreak itself usually can have body aches and fever.,At the first sign of a possible outbreak I would beging taking the medication. It would be taken twice daily for three days. Discussed possible daily dosage if outbreaks became more frequent. I decided to try a more natural approach with Lysine taken at any signs with very similar results.
patient,41,female,Cold Sores,heavy bleeding during periods,Birth control,Valtrex (Valacyclovir) ,Anti-Infectives-Systemic Anti-Infectives-Systemic Antiviral-Agents Antiviral-Agents,7,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,500 mg daily  taken once per day for the period of 8 months,It definitely reduced the size and severity of the cold sore but now I get the more frequently.  Like twice a month!!,ocassional diarrhea and headache.,I began getting cold sores about 5 years ago; when I was 35.  I would get them 3-4 times per year; especially when the weather changed.  My doctor prescribed me a 1mg tablet to take 2 of them in the morning and 2 at night at the onset of a cold sore.  It helped but the sore still ran its ugly course; even if I caught it right at the tingling point before it came out.  When I was 38; I went on birth control.  After about a year of being on Yaz; I began getting cold sores EVERY MONTH!  I told my doctor but she didn't think it was from the birth control - even though I read that BC suppresses your immune system; and anything that does that can allow for more instances of cold sores.  I went off the Yaz for 2 months; and STILL got cold sores during those two months.  So maybe she was right.  She then prescribed Valtrez 500mg once per day and I've been taking that since 9/09.  Still; like clockwork I get a cold sore every single month.  Either right before during or after my period.  So I think it's hormonal.  something is triggering them every month.  I've changed my diet completely; I take 4;000mg of Lsyine each day; I've tried the Red Marine Algae also.  No difference.  I'm a high stress personality anyway which doesn't help.  My doctor prescribed a mild sedative just to take the edge off and it does work great.  But still; the cold sores come like clockwork.  I just don't get it.  I'm starting a new job soon where I'll actually have to go to an office each day.  for the last 10 years I've been a road warrior; so I've been able to get around having to see people by making my own hours; especially if a cold sore errupts.  Now I don't know what I'll do.  It scares me and I'm stressed over that as well which doesn't help.  I feel plagued!  I don't know what else to try.  Maybe Acyclovir?

If my stress levels are up i usually get one as well either under my nose or on my lips. After finally using valtex my symptoms were reduced to 7 days. Prior to that i would be suffering for almost 3 weeks with theses bad boys!!!! Key to survival; take this pill as soon as u feel the tingle; if not it will come just not as bad.

I started this medicine while I had a cold sore with the help of the medicine and the Abreva the pain was decreased and it went away a lot faster.,The first time I took this medicine was during the day and I had to run errands and I was very dizzy and I kept having dry heaves; so I had decided to take it at night and I was still up last night with nausea. ,Once a day; everyday for the next four months to see how well it works.

Often; it would halt the development and the redness and swelling would disappear after a day or two; without the sore blistering/weeping/scabbing.  For my body; Valtrex has proven to be far more effective than either Famvir; or Zoviraz.   It is surprising how many people either do not treat cold sores; or are not aware of any new treatments after Zovirax.       ,Slight dizziness and tiredness; very minor.  ,2x 1000mg tablets every 12 hours for 1 day.

My acne worsened using Differin -- some say it is because the impurities are being purged from beneath the outer layers of the skin.  I don't know if I completely buy this theory though I would have believed it if it showed some improvement after three months.  Unfortunately; it did not.,There were no side effects to the treatment except that it worsened my breakouts.  However; it did nothing to take down the flares even after three months of treatment.  Soon after I stopped using it; my skin improved.  So now; I choose to use an exfoliation product and a separate over the counter acne treatment product.,differin did not help prevent acne or get rid of current acne.  it worsened the condition though it was explained that as it helped the skin exfoliate; the impurities beneath the outer skin surfaced.  however; there were no improvements after three months of application.

I also used it on my forehead; where I have brown spots from a college-days sunburn (appx 10 years ago).  The spots have clearly faded; though are not completely gone.,Side effects were peeling and some redness; but only occurred the time that i used too much Differin.  I knowingly put more than prescribed on my chin in hopes of getting rid of an outbreak before vacation.  The redness and peeling was very noticeable.,Treatment includes adding only about 1/3 pea sized amount to my chin area and the same amount to my forehead after cleansing at night.  This I do daily.  I combined this with a regular alpha-hydroxy exfoliation night creme (applied after the Differin dries) in order to catalyze (by my own approximation) the skin rejuvenation/renewal.

In addition; my skin became more sensitive to environmental stresses like wind; cold; and sun.  Consequently my face often appeared flush.,I used a non-soap cleanser to wash my face twice daily.

There were times when my skin felt warm. My skin peeled a little bit and felt and appeared dry. There was some periodic itching. My skin became more sensitive and something like a scrape would hurt. Additionally and most noticeably even though I avoided my eye area the differin would make the skin around my eyes sore; red and flaky. I'm not sure how it spread to my eyes when I avoided rubbing it in anywhere close; but it did.       ,I was directed to apply once or twice a week and build up to once per night as tolerated. I was able to tolerate once per night application for the entire course of treatment. There were some negative side effects (itching; sensitivity; warmth; and redness especially around my eyes) and not much in the way of positive side effects. I am now considering asking my dermatologist for a different prescription.

I noticed that it didn't help with the amount of bowl movements I was having but it did help stop the internal bleeding.,Nausea; cramping; abdominal pain were just some of the bigger side effects. Sometimes the stomach pain was so painful it was worse then an actual flare-up.,I stopped taking Asacol because of the intense stomach pain it caused me as well as the nausea. I found that while taking Asacol; my falre-ups did decrease but the side effects outweighed the benefits.

I was getting a headache almost dailey. It was affecting my job and family life. My migraine would start with a mild headache on the left side of my face and the pain would increase with time. Taking Relpax at the onset really helped to slow down the pain and in most cases stop it.,The side effects were mild compared to the pain. Around 30 minutes after taking the pill; I would feel a little tired and sleepy.  However the feeling would not be so severe that I could not work or continue daily tasks.  This side effect would pass in about 1-2 hours.,At the onset of the headache; I would take a pill.  Some of my headaches would start at night; around 3:00AM and I would lay in bed hoping the pain would go away.  WRONG decision.  I quickly learned to take the pill as soon as I felt ANY sign of a headache; no matter what time of day or night.  If you don't take the pill at the onset of a headache; the pill will not be effective in stopping the pain and you will have to ride the headache out.  That could take a day to several days before the pain subsides.  It is extremely important to take this pill at the onset of a headache.

I'd feel tired/lethargic following the initiation of it's effects; but the fatigue might be related to the Migraine headache rather than the drug (??).  I would sometimes get a "rebound" migraine headache of decreased intensity approximately 2 days after the treatment.  ,Relpax was prescribed on an "as needed" basis for my migraines.  It was taken after the onset of migraine; usually when I realized that it would not go away via conventional over the counter headache medicines.  It starts to take effect at approximately 1-2 hours after I take the pill.  This medicine has been a "life saver" for me.  It allows me to function and go on with important things in my life even when I get a migraine.

I kept applying it diligently as prescribed. In c couple of days there was a rash on the area  ( I called the doctor about it and she said to stop using it for a couple of days and then apply it ; since that might have a been a  normal side effect). I did what she told me to; so I reapplied the drug again in a couple of days; there was redness and irritation and then later on the following day I had a cold sore developing on the spot (the affected area where I was applying the cream was the upper lip and the noso-labial folds). Plus to everything else I had a bad a headache; which as I found later could have been the side effect of that medication. I went to another dermatologist and she said that she would have never prescribed that medication for the face especially if I have a tendency to develop cold sores because that medication serves as a immunosuppressant.

On rare occasions; I have to take 2 Maxalt in a 24 hour period. I do not feel addicted in any way. I always carry Maxalt with me just in case. Works best at first sign of migraine. ,In the 70's and 80's I just had to suffer from the pain and miss work days and cry in a dark room. I would take OTC sleep aids just to escape the agony. Found a Dr who prescibed Imitrex about 1989 which helped; but then in the late 90's my new doctor who also was a migraine sufferer suggested I try Maxalt and it has been what I prefer. My headaches are fewer now; probably because of Menopause which I am now using bio-identical hormones; biest and progesterone.

I was given Ceftin (I believe; can't remember the dose).  I was also prescribed an inhaler and the prednisone. I had never taken a steroid of any kind before.  The first couple of days were okay; though I noticed I felt constantly hungry or my stomach hurt slightly; it was actually hard to tell which it was. So; I was eating a lot of crackers and thinks that I thought would help.  After the five days my skin began to break out all along the jaw line and forehead; which was not usually a problem for me. The breakout was so bad; I went to see a dermatologist who put me on a month of tetracycline; which cleared up the skin.  Overall; the prednisone made me feel lousy!  I hope I never ever need it for anything again.

Although steroids are being scrutinized in the media at this time; they do have a place in the treatment of life threatening episodes of asthma and other diseases that casue severe inflammation.  I do not care to be on prednisone for any period of time; however; breathing is necessary to life and the prednisone offers a quick relief of the symptoms.,While taking the prednisone I had an increase in blood pressure.  I also was very perspired while the dose was higher and felt extremely edgy and agitated.,The prednisone was prescribed for a rebound effect after an anaphylactic reaction.  While at the ER I was given solumedrol and benadryl.  Since I have asthma; a prednisone taper was prescribed in the event that a rebound effect occured; which it did.  I began the taper immediately upon the worsening of symptoms.  It took about 3 hours for the prednisone to begin working.  During that time; there was a back and forth response from my body as it fought the prednisone for control.  During this event; I learned that I will always use my Epipen in the future as adrenalin is not always part of the protocol at the ER.  The adrenalin stops the initial reaction and may prevent the need for the prednisone later.

The prednisone worked like a charm; but at a cost.,Sleeplessness!  Taking the prednisone was like drinking ten cups of coffee every night or like being on speed.  I had unnatural amounts of energy -- nervous energy -- and wore myself out during the time I was taking the prednisone.  It always helped to clear up the infection; but then I had to recover from the prednisone.  This is a scary drug.,In addition to whatever antibiotic I was currently on; I was to take 9 mg. of prednisone -- the first few times; it was 3 mg with each meal; but that was really too much; so later we did the three tabs all at once in the morning -- a day for several days; sometimes as few as 7; sometimes as many as 15.  Then; I had to taper off the amount I took for several days; in 3 mg increments for a few days each new dose.  Finally; I would be off it.  This time.

I then will bee taking 1 pill every two days.  The trick is to take as little as possible while not taking too little and having to start over again

One year it did not totally prevent the rash and so the following year we increased the dosage.  ,None,I get Polymorphous Light Eruption (PMLE) each year when I go to Cancun on vacation in March.  It is a very painful; itchy rash (appears like a heat rash) which I get reagardless of sunblock usage.  This is apparently a fairly common condition in women of fair complexion (like me) who go to very sunny areas after a long period of no sun exposure.  It began happening when I was in my 20's and it took several years (and the Internet as well as a dermatologist) to diagnose what was happening.  Since then; the use of Predisone (beginning 4 days before my vacation and slowly decreasing the dosage over a period of 8 days) has prevented the rash and mad my vacations a success!

It seemed to help treat the ulcers in my colon. It also let me be able to eat normal foods because when a person has Ulcerative Colitis they have to monitor what they eat and usually have to eat bland foods. It really helped me a lot but the side effects took away from the overall rating. The side effects most likely worsened because I was on the drug for a long period of time.,I had dry eyes; trouble gaining weight; and loss of energy.,My doctor had me start out by taking 6 tablets a  day; three at breakfast and three at dinner. After 2 and a half months he had me start taking 4 tablets a day and 1/2 a pill less every week; until i was down to 1/2 a pill a day for a week. After that I stopped taking the pills.

When i first wake up my face; esp eyes; are very puffy but it seems to go down with in an hour. Dry mouth; metallic taste in my mouth. Increased hunger and thirst. Hot flushes. Few irrational mood swings but nothing to serious. Am taking the second course at the moment and the side effects dont seem to be as bad besides the insomnia but am only on day 2 of the course and am home from work with a cold i picked up at the end of the 1st course that i cant seem to get rid of so im guessing i would have the same side effects if i was doing my normal daily work.,Was put on Prednisone for asthma which i have not suffered from since i was a child. Had 6weeks of a cough which i though was a developing chest infection that i was fighting off as never turned into anything and i felt fine. My wheeze got really bad so went to gp who put me straight on prednisone. After 5days the wheezing decreased and i felt slightly better. 2days after stopping my course i was getting wheezy again and starting coughing more. Went back to the gp and he put me on another course of prednisone which i am taking at the moment along with a salbutamol inhaler.

I could have just taken Benadryl; and although it would have taken longer to recover from the allergic reaction (possibly another week); I would have been normal without side effects; and without withdrawal effects.  The drug took a modest problem and created a far worse one.  I told the physician I reacted strongly to drugs.

I am diabetic and was warned that it would raise my blood sugars; but it significantly reduced the night sugars.,Extreme shortness of breath (exhausted just walking from bedroom into bathroom and adding an inhaler did not significantly improve the condition; dizziness; chest pressure; water retention; confusion. The night sugars dipped dangerously low so I discontinued my night injection of Lantus. I have lost my independence with the use of this drug and become homebound.,After the diagnosis of PMR; I was instructed to take 10 mg. in the morning. Although the pain diminished; it was still high so dosage was increased to 15 mg. I repeatedly advise the rheumatolist of the breathing problems to no avail. The family doctor suggested dropping the dosage to 7 1/2 mg. per day; but the pain became extreme again so I went back to the initial dose of 10 m.g. The rheumatolist has suggested that I will be on prednisone for a year.

When the Prednisone is in my system it feels like I am almost completely better. Once it wears off (before my next day) I am still sick but better than the day before.,Some side effects for me are wide awake; hyper; jittery; plugged ears (needs to be popped) joint pain and discomfort in my knees; ankles; and hips (almost like an arthritis feeling but not sore; just awkward.,Before I started on the Prednisone I was sick for 2 weeks with a viral infection the chest (chest) my wheezing was really bad and I was prescribed to Symbicort Corticosteroid inhaler twice per day to help with the inflammation and airways. After a few days I was still getting worse and did feel  minimal comfort from the puffer; and my overall infection was getting worse. I went back to the doctor and they added in a Ventolin puffer to open the airways 2 puffs 4 times per day in between the symbicort. 5 days later I went back to the doctor wheezing more and with a sort of stuffy nose and serious nasal pain (mostly from coughing so much. He told me I caught a sinus infection since the steroid lowers your emmmune system and makes it easier to catch another infection. He then prescribed me to 50 mg of Prednisone each day for a 3 day term so that it could tackle the inflammation fast so that the cortisone puffer would be able to catch up ( it couldn't work fast enough as it takes a while to start working) and also prescribed me to Amoxicillin for the sinus infection (since it was caused by bacteria) He said he would have prescribed me the antibiotic even if i didn't catch the sinus infection as an immune booster since prednisone lowers your immune system.. I took my first prednisone yesterday for the first time; it made me feel good for 9 hours or so but gave me some joint pain. The next day I felt a little better but still coughing and sick until I took the Prednisone again. (today at 2:00pm) It is now 11:00pm and I am flighing high (thats probably why I am writing in a blog and feel awesome; I feel like I could run a marathon. I also just drank a coffee and I don't think it helped. No coughing. Hopefully I can sleep tonight.. I used to take Ritalin for ADD and this kind of feels like that. I think tomorrow I will feel a little better; great again when I am on the Prednisone; and hopefully after that the puffer will Finnish off fixing the inflammation. Did anyone get hearing loss when taking prednisone? Its like when your on an airplane and your ears need to be popped but you cant pop them. I checked online and all I could find is prednisone fixes hearing loss..haha.. weird anyways.. Overall I think it works great!

Nightmares.,Client developed rash with many itchy bumps; could not get sleep or keep hands off bumps. Prednisone temporarily provided the client with mild relief; also calamine lotion was applied topically and seemed to provide some relief. Rash is subsiding mildly after one week of the Prednisone and calamine lotion. I would say if this symptom comes back that the client would use it again based on this experience.

My Dermatologist prescribed Tri-Luma cream to lighten the spots and also said it would help redice the appearance of my wrinkles.   ,A few days after use my skin started peeling where I had been using the cream. The cream had an unpleasant odor.,After pregnancy my upper lip remainedmarked with dark spots - melasma. My Dermatologist prescribed Tri-Luma cream to lighten the spots and also said it would help redice the appearance of my wrinkles. I used the cream each night. The texture was thick and the smell was not appealing. A few days after use my skin started peeling where I had been using the cream. The peeling was annoying as I would constantly have to put moisturizer on to stick the skin back down. After a month of dilligent nightly usage I did not notice a lightening of my dark spots nor any reduction in my wrinkles.  Perhaps with continued use my spots would have lightened but honestly; I couldn't stand walking around with skin peels hanging off my face. The Dr should have advised me about the peeling. I was very dissappointed as this prescription cream cost $100.

The flaking is similar to normal dry skin symptoms. I also developed very minor scabby areas below my eyes; just above the cheek application site. The corners of my mouth turned red and became irritated; which was annoying and unbecoming.,I basically bought Tri Luma to treat a cosmetic issue. It helped relieve the problem a bit; but it created additionaly cosmetic problems. I am more embarrassed by the redness at my mouth than I am by the discoloration...actually; I don't know which is worse. I do not know if I would recommend the product to those with normal skin; but I would definitely not recommend it to those with sensitive skin.

I've just spoiled my skin and pigment spots look now dark brown and they are very obvious.,Bad experience for $200!!!,Hi! I am a russian (european race) who has migrated from Sweden to the USA. I have developed melasma (dark spots) under my eyes and on my forehead. I visited a dermatologist in the USA; FL about 1 month ago. He prescribed me Tri Luma that contains 4% of Hudroquinone. Have you ever read about Hydroquinone?- I asked him. As I investigated it I found the information that hydroquinone has been banned in many european countries including France; Sweden and Russia etc; for concerns about increased cancer risk.The FDA admitted that the risk of using the drug is not known and more testing needs to be done.In fact; the FDA also warned that hydroquinone has been linked to a condition that disfigures the skin. Anyway;I tried the cream; a sample that the doctor gave to me. He prescribed to use it twice a week - Mondays and Fridays. It was terrible!!! I used it just once a week on my pigment spots because my skin got red; burning and after 1 week it was peeling. Some doctors prescribe to use it once; twice a day!!! I put it on only once a week. Ok; after 1 month; 4 treatments I have the result: my pigment spots have not been improved at all. Moreover; the skin is burnt and now I have very obvious dark red-brown spots. I really look terrible. I can't put on any sunscreen because the skin is damaged by Tri Luma. I am so happy that I didn't buy the full size cream which costs $200 and the insurance doesn't cover it. I don't want to buy cancer for $200. Thanks. I've also contacted russian and swedish doctors. They've forbade to use it strongly!!! They've suggested to use natural products such as juice of lemon; parcley; put camomile teabags on dark spots; oatmeal etc... and of course; avoid the Sun. Please be aware; read more information online.

Meanwhile i DO NOT use any scrubs or rub my face ; just gently; also NO masks or toners etc. Close to 2 wks; when in a hot shower gentle exfoliate; you will see dead skin coming off. dry your face and ts gonna look dry; flaky and terrible. use PURE COCOBUTTER on your face during the day; then only at night use the triluma; and repeat the exfoliate every few days; then the cocobutter etc; until you get results. My face looks amazing after using this process; but i do not have acne; so not sure how it would  work with the cocobutter; might make the acne worse.  good luck!,dry skin,explained above

Another 15% of the time it takes up to 2 hours.  5% of the time the pain is only lessen.  However lately some of the single dose units do not discharge the medication properly. Instead of a spray; you get a drop or two.  When this happens; the frequency of the pain not going away by at least 75% goes up. A couple of times it seemed virtually ineffective.  If the quality control doesn't improve; I may have to switch to a different Triptan.,Generally I fell a little dull or numb in the head; very slightly dizzy. Rarely there is a little tightness in the chest.,Since insurance only covers 2 per week and the doctor doesn't want me to take it too ofter for fear of rebound headaches; I generally wait until the headache is fairly bad and is interfering with my ability to work.  I will frequently take Tramadol; ibuprofen; naproxen; or acetophenamin earlier. These work maybe 25% of the time; or take the pain down enough so that I can avoid taking the tripan.

There are 2 ways I take the drug.  If I feel the headache start and I am at work I take a pill and usually I get relief within 15 minutes.

On the other hand if I am able to take the pill and lay down for 20 minutes then usually I can get up and resume all of my activities.

Aciphex is the only medicine he can take and live a happy ;normal healthy lifestyle without becoming sick.My husband still takes the Aciphex; but if he had to can actually go for months without it.

Then; the daily dosage needed to be increased to twice daily.  At twice daily; the same effectiveness has been maintained.  It definitely controls the GERD & heartburn.

I rarely had heartburn even when I ate spicey foods. Even though I still may have heartburn occasionally; the tightness of my chest and the frequent indigestion has almost completely disappeared. Before I had indigestion at random times during the day; which would cause unexpected chest pains.,I did not experience any side effects. Possibly because I did not the pills on an empty stomache.,My doctor asked me to take Nexium once a day until they were gone to see if the tightness in my check; the indigestion; and the heartburn could be cured by the pills.

I also has benefited from further damage to my esphogus from the acid reflux. I do not have bad breath from the acid and i am no longer horse in my throat when i talk alot. The nexxium has stopped my stomach from producing acid.,After about a couple of months i began to experience severe stomach cramping; bloating; and diareaha.  My body is now completely depended on the drug and my understanding is that the pill is telling my body not to produce acid which in turn works harder to produce more; which makes since when i have tried to go off of it my acid reflux was 20 times worse.  My body has become completely dependent on the drug.,The treatment details were that i did not need to change my diet; but to just take one pill every day and that would take care of my issue with my body producing to much acid.

Occasional stomach discomfort;gas; diarrhea; but these could also be associated with irritable bowel syndrome.  All in all; very few problems with this medication compared to its benefits.,Previously took Losec; but continued to have problems with choking spasms; which became increasingly distressing.  The doctor prescribed Nexium at a lower dose; 30 mg.; which helped but did not eliminate symptoms.  Increased to 40; and have been happy with this dose ever since.  The doctor tried reducing it once; but I had a choking spasm within two weeks; so we increased it again.

Important to take the medicine early in the day; when I first started taking the medicine I wasnt told that and I didnt see much a change in the heartburn or other symptoms.After a couple months the doctor on a followup visit avised me to take them in the morning before I eat anything. That made a huge difference in how effective the drug was on my system.

Sometimes the reflux was so severe that I could not sleep. I changed my diet and tried many drugs; including ranitidine; Prilosec and Pepcid AC--none of whic helped. Although Nexium is very similar to Prilosec in its formulation; for some reason Nexium allowed my esophageal lining to heal and after a one month treatment; my heartburn is much better as long as I continue to watch my diet.,With Prilosec; I occasionally had stomach cramping and nausea; but I did not experience any side effects with Nexium.,I took 1 capsule (40 MG) of Nexium daily for 30 days. Because my heartburn was typically worse in the evenings and at night; I took it in the late afternoon about 45 minutes prior to dinner. After one month; the improvements have been quite noticeable and I have been able to switch back to less powerful; over-the-counter medications.

First; it completely stopped the constant heartburn.  I have not had one second of heart burn since I started taking the drug.  Second; it healed the Barret's esophagus completely.  This has been verified by my GI doctor via two upper endoscopies and biopsies.  Nexium is a miracle drug.,When I started taking the drug; I experienced some diarrhea.,I take the nexium first thing in the morning; 30 minutes before I eat breakfast

It isn't a complete fix.  I can't blame the drug for this; but it doesn't help at all if I drink caffeine.,No known side effect,I take it once daily on an empty stomach.  I sometimes take an additional dose at night if I'm having problems; but that doesn't seem to do my any good.

She couldn't lie flat to sleep because of the reflux of acid into the esophagus.  She often had such pain from the reflux that she only slept 3-4 hours a night.,Within 2 days the reflux symptoms were controlled.  She only had problems if she ate an excessive amount late in the evening and needed to sleep on a wedge to prevent sudden reflux while asleep.  She has noticed that if she does not take the Nexium; the symptoms reappear within 2-3 days.,THe patient had been treated with Prilosec for reflux.  While being evaluated for chronic insomnia; a 24 hour study was done to constantly measure the pH of her stomach/esophagus junction.  The study found; while using Prilosec; her stomach acid was 10 times what was considered normal.  She began using Nexium and repeated the 24 hour acid study about 6 months later.  Using Nexium; the stomach acid pH was normal.  The patient takes Nexium once a day; in the morning one hour prior to eating.

This medication is so much better than taking antacid tablets day after day and meal after meal.,Following my initial dose of the medication it would take several hours for my symptoms to subside. They did subside in the first days but would return after about 8 hours or so.  After about a week of daily dosing my acid reflux did not return regularly and my stomach pains subsided as well.  By the end of week 2 I was symptom free. After I stopped my course of treatment many weeks went by with no return of symptoms. Since then; I have had one flare up.  I restarted my course of treatment with the same results and now have been close to a year symptom free.  I am very; very happy with Nexium.

I itched all over; broke out in hives.  I had chest pain and swelling of the lips and eyes.  I had to immediately take benedril to stop the drug reactions.  I felt nausiated for days after the adverse drug reaction.  ,I had been taking Prevacid for years with success and no adverse drug reactions. I had to switch because my insurance would not pay for the Prevacid any more because there was a Generic form of Prevacid.  I tried the generic but it was not effective so I was given the prescription for Nexium.  The Nexium was effective but I was highly allergic to it.

Heartburn was not a significant complaint.  I lost about 5 lbs due to a loss of appetite.  I first started on a dose of 20 mg/day; and decided to increase to 40mg/day when the symptoms were not fully alleviated.  That dosage helped the symptoms; but I still have to be careful when; what and how much I eat or the problem will start up.,None really.  however; I am concerned about the correlation to osteoporosis; since proton pumps are probably involved in bone remodeling.  Now I take only 20mg daily as needed.    ,Take 20mg first thing in the morning about half an hour before breakfast; or before I have a meal I know will cause problems - Italian food; garlic; spicy; etc.

It seemed to calm my heartburn for about 3-4 days.  Then the heartburn returned along with nasaus.  I continued Prilosec for about 10 days; but my heartburn became too intense and I reverted back to Previcid.  Previcid seems to be the only drug that completely stops the heartburn.

Found I had Barretts and the treatment cleared up the Barretts after about 5 years.,I have an artifical hip and have constant discomfort where implant was put into femur. I was having quite a bit of back pain and about a year ago started lifting moderate weights about 3 days a week and that seemed to clear up the problem. Sometimes when I overeat or accidently drink a lot of alcohol I get extreme chest pain. I actually break out into a sweat and the pain works from center of my back to front of my chest. After it subsides which is usually 15 to 20 minutes I will be extremely exhaused.The first time it happened I thought I was actually having a heart attack.So to counter the issue I try to eat less at a meal and nibble more often during the day. I still don't know I the moderate discomfort in my leg is the medication; so I guess I will live with it.I have read a bit about the different symptoms and being a little older its hard to determine if its drugs or age causing some of the issues.,I take 20mg everyday before I eat dinner. To me the side effects have been worth it I don't believe I would be here today if I wasn't taking this medication. My dad died of stomach cancer. My brother and sister exhibit the gerd symptoms and are also on the drug now.

The heartburn started again as soon as I stopped taking it. So I began treatment again. 6 months passed and I stopped taking it. The heartburn came back; and seemed worse even. The doctor said I should try another 6 month treatment. I did; and the same exact thing happened. This went on for about three years. I asked why this wasn't curing my reflux. The doctor quite frankly told me that it wasn't a cure; but a "treatment for the symptoms". I was told that I would probably be on it for the rest of my life.,Constipation; dry mouth and some mild dizziness that would go away after medication was stopped for a few days.,I was given Prilosec prescription at a dose of 45mg per day.

Severe heartburn occurred 5-7 times a week before treatment; and was brought down to 2-3 times a week during treatment.,Chronic constipation; dry mouth and mild dizziness. The side effects; aside from the constipation were usually mild and went away after treatment was discontinued. ,40mg a day of Prilosec were prescribed to me after I complained to my doctor of chronic heartburn symptoms. I began taking it that day; and once every morning there after. Heartburn symptoms began to subside after 2-3 days of taking it. Mild side effects after about a week. The most noticeable and bothersome side effect (constipation) began after about 9 days of treatment. After putting up with it for a week I went to my doctor. He prescribed a mild laxative and suggested I stay on the Prilosec for at least 2 months to get the drugs full benefits. I did; but the constipation was still there (laxatives helped some). The doctor switched me to Nexium; which worked just as well and without the constipation.

If I skipped a day; I would start to have severe gastric distress from acid reflux; would then have to take the Prilosec as well as an instant-acting Tums or Rolaids.  ,If I took the pill and also several Tums or rolaids; I would get diarrhea.,I worry about taking a pill for acid reflux because I read a study that says that this type of medication can also leach the calcium out of your system.  I am 49 and have a family history of osteoporosis so this concerns me.  I have been tested for osteoporosis and my bone density and strength is within normal limits.

Prevents burns to esophagus that can lead to esophageal cancer and ongoing pain. ,None that I experienced. ,I was diagnosed with a moderate to severe case of GERG with an esophageal hernia over 7 years ago; and spent two years at physicians request trying a mix of different OTC drugs.   NO OTC drug worked to stop the burning and the coughing after meals caused by GERD. I tried most everything you'd find in the OTC shelf in a drug store.  Tums; Zantac; etc. etc. etc.   Finally; doctor ordered Prilosec for me; 1/day; 20mg; taken in am before eating.  At that time Prilosec with still not yet over the counter; still requiring a physician prescription.  It worked beautifully and I have taken it since; daily.  If I don't take it; symptoms immediately occur after eating.   It does NOT however stop the cough that occurs after eating or otherwise from GERD. Recently; I have had to increase my dose "occasionally" to 1 pill also before dinner; but that is usually only if I'm eating later than expected.  I have never taken Nexium -- the HMO didn't cover it; but since Prilosec works so well; I don't feel the need to experiment.

The only drawback was the need to eat within 30 minutes of taking the medication.  There were times when an unavoidable delay in the mealtime made it necessary to eat something else in the interim.,I didn't have usual GERD symptoms of heart burn.  I was skeptical that my stomach was producing too much acid.  I tried other home remedies like drinking diluted apple cider after a meal that seemed to work at times but didn't always.  After my doctor prescribed prilosec; it took several weeks before relief was complete.  I am still taking the medication but have scaled back to 20 mg just once a day.

Being someone who doesn't like to take drugs regularly I decided to use on an as needs basis; so I now take if I feel the regular need to burp and have the early signs of indegestion (i.e. a knotty feeling in the centre of my chest; below the breast bone. For me; this drug acts quite quickly (about 15 mins) and goes a long way to alleviate the symptoms.,None,Not sure I understand this request! I was prescribed a daily dose for 28 days but use on an as needs basis.

Also a reduction in bloating of the stomack and cramps. i was also able to eat a more varied diet without the awful symptoms of burning and indigestion which normally accompany the acid reflux.,i have to say that i didn't really have any major side effects from this drug; ceratinly none that would out weigh the positives.i did experience constipation on a regular basis but i increased my fibre and fruit and vegatable intake to counteract this problem.i also did experience and increase in headaches; but they were very mild.,Losec tablets contain a medicine called omeprazole.This belongs to a group of medicines called "proton pump inhibitors" They work by reducing the amount of acid that your stomach produces. If you suffer with acid reflux; this means that the stomach produces too much acid which can cause pain and burning and often travels up your throat causing damage to it.

When the patent for Prilosec expired my doctor prescribed Nexium which in a matter of  hours sent me to the emergency room with pancake size hives and disabling swelling of the joints. I went back to Prilosec (over the counter now) and  have been taking this medication faithfully for the past 17 or so years with no side effects or allergic reactions.,40 mg. once a day and more recently (for the past 5 or 6 years) 40 mg. every two days.

It is normally taken  daily; 1/2 hour before breakfast.,There were no sside effects.,This generic version of Prilosec OTC can be taken daily  on a long term basis to prevent/control the symptoms of acid reflux. It is very easy to remember to take it; as it is normally taken at the same time every day-- before breakfast.

I am able to eat what I want whenever I want.  This is after nearly 2 years (before going on the drug) of trying to change my diet and lifestyle but no matter what I did; I could not find relief of constant; daily heartburn.  My days used to revolve around juggling over the counter heartburn medicines. This drug finally gave me relief.,No side effects.,Unlike another user claims; this drug does not "teach" your body to produce more acid.  Once it's out of your system; it's out of your system; and yes the symptoms of acid reflux will likely return because this drug is not meant to cure any underlying condition; but simply to manage the painful symptoms of GERD and other problems with producing excess stomach acid.  I will probably have to take it forever; but it's worth it to me to take a medicine every day versus suffering every day with constant heartburn and acid reflux.

I went to doc; they gave me a sample of Prilosec. I began on it and developed the problems. I stopped taking it for about two days; I started feeling bleh and the symptoms Prilosec caused started to go away. To make sure it was the Prilosec; I took it again. The side affects returned within a hour. I am now struggling to get rid of the symptoms and the withdrawal. I would not recommend Prilosec to anyone.

Because everyone is complaining that they cannot get off of it now...

I changed and stopped eating pizza; meat balls or extremely spicy foods; but if possible I will take a Tums before just to reduce any chance of problems.,I don't believe I had any side effects.  I know Protonix just like Nexium can be an addictive medicine simply because it work so well.  Some people seem to have minor side effects; but I am in great health and in good shape and I did not seem to have any side effects from using Protonix.,I was prescribed Protonix 20 mg which I took daily for 30 days.  Extended use is not recommended; and I did not surpass the 30 days.  I do buy extra strength Tums and take it if I have any real acid or spicy foods.  The bottom line is I had a lot of pain with my ucler which came out of nowhere and after almost 2 weeks of pain I decided I needed to see a doctor.  Soon after taking Protonix my pain went away; but as with any ulcer a diet change might be in order.  Similar drugs are Nexium; Prevacid; Prilosec; etc.

Protonix seems to be the one that I can tolerate. But I still occasionally get the bloat/overstuffed feeling.,Not sure what this means - I take a single dose in the AM and try to avoid trigger foods/beverages like chocolate and caffeine. 
patient,43,female,GI irritation,none,naproxen,Protonix (Pantoprazole) ,Anti-Ulcer-Agents Gastrointestinal-Agents Proton-Pump-Inhibitors,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,not sure  (dosage frequency: 1 time per day)  for the period of 1 month,Significant reduction in the amount of pain that patient had on a daily basis.  Pain was not only lessened by time it was felt was lessened as well,This medication; or the combination of the medication with naproxen; caused bouts of diarrhea and/or constipation.,Take the protonix one time daily with 1 tab naproxen.

At three months of treatment; the pain from the ulcer has receded considerably. Because of the ulcer; however; I still have to be careful not to eat anything too acidic--very fresh pasta sauce with chunks of tomato--or too spicy.,Shortly after starting treatment; I developed diarrhea. It only lasted for a few days; but then I continue to have somewhat pasty stools; with occasional bouts of diarrhea again.,I went to the ER with severe burning in the chest. The doctors there suspected either cardiac problems or a blood clot in the lungs. Once they made certain there were no blood clots; and that the EKG and cardiac enzyme levels were normal; they started me on IV protonix. The next day I was switched to pill form of the protonix; and the improvement was amazing. Within thirty-six hours the pain was minimal; and by the third day of treatment; it was virtually gone. Since then; I haven't had any recurrence; and remain on the protonix only because of the ulcer; which is improving; even though at a slower pace. Overall; it's an excellent medication; and had worked wonders for me.

Bending over still causes bile in throat.  Nighttime coughing still happens. Certain foods definitely trigger irritation.  Protonix was the last of 3 or 4 similar medications I tried (Nexium; etc) and all others had much worse side effects (headaches and dry mouth particularly).  ,Mild nausea at first; gradually disappearing after about a month of treatment. ,basically 1 pill in the AM and avoid triggering foods such as chocolate.  Fortunately food triggers seem to be time-of-day sensitive. For instance; I can drink coffee but only in the AM.

I had tried just about every reflux drug out there; but they either didn't work or had unacceptable side effects. When I first tried Protonix I couldn't believe how normal I felt within a couple days. It works so well for me; I forget I have reflux sometimes. I haven't noticed any issues with foods or coffee since taking it.

I feel 100% better 90% of the time; and when I don't; it's usually because I forgot to take my pill the previous day.  I would prefer for my pain to be treated by diet changes alone; but it's nice to have a pill to rely on.

I haven't had any issues with heartburn or acid reflux whatsoever. Stomach pain (from possible ulcer-haven't had results back from test to diagnose that) has decreased significantly.,No side effects that I know of; however my father (who also takes protonix) had to discontinue his regimen for a week because of a test he had to have done said his acid reflux came back about 2 days after he stopped and it was 10x worse than it was before treatment. I guess this isn't a drug one should go off of completely.,I pill a day and all has been well. =D

I spent most days feeling unbelievably bloated; even after only a few bites of food; sometimes. Protonix was prescribed to me in combination with Domperidone to reduce bloating; belching; and an acid-burning sensation in the stomach.,None; really; that I can specifically blame on this drug. I had actually reacted fairly badly to other; similar drugs. The famous "purple pill" Nexium had actually given me a brutal headache; sore-throat; and even a racing heart-beat at times. I was somewhat anxious about taking another very similar medication; but Pantoprazole did not bother me at all (I have since read that Pantoprazole is one of the acid-reducers least likely to cause side-effects).,Treatment has been ongoing for several months and is set to continue. While still not quite "normal"; I am feeling much better after several months of this therapy and will be discussing reducing my dosage and/or going off the drug completely in the next month or two.

I had read the list; but appear to be having no trouble. I have been taking the medication for over four years and am still taking the medication.

My regular every day treatment dose is one 40 mg pill; but have been told at two different times by two different doctors to double up on that for two months.  I notice improvement but once regular dosage is resumed the symptoms usually flare up.

I tried topical anti-itch creams and put ice on it to soothe the itching but nothing relieved my symptoms more than slightly. I thought it would eventually go away by itself. After suffering for 4 or 5 weeks I went to my doctor. He took 1 look at my arms and said I had hives. Probably due to seasonal allergies. He wrote a prescription for Zantac and sent me on my way. Within the 1st day of taking the medication my hives were less than half than they'd been. Within a week they were nearly gone.

At the end of the two weeks period of taking 2x tabs per day I felt completely back to normal.  I ceased taking the Zantac after my follow up visit with the doctor but was advised to keep some handy for future use.

After several months of treatment my stomach; which previously felt nauseated on a daily basis; felt much better and very rarely caused me discomfort.,I didnt seem to have any negative side effects.  ,I am not sure if it is related to the ranitidine but since I began using it I have not contracted any viruses.

I THEN FOUND OUT THAT THER WAS AN AUSTRAILAN  DOCTER WHO FOUND THAT IN SOME CASES ULCERS WERE ONLY A BACTERIA AND A SIMPLE TEST WOULD FIND THAT OUT AND IF THAT WAS THE CASE A SHORT COUSE OF ANTIBOTICS AND AN ANTI ACID FOR THE SAME PERIOD OF TIME WHISLT YOU WERE TALIKG THE COURSE OF ANTIBOTICS; WOULD GET RID OF THE PROBLEM; WHICH IN MY CASE IT DID.

When I've tried to use natural products like Alo Vera juice or licorice-based products; to take care of the problem; it is very difficult; and I have to take products throughout the day to have any success whatsoever. So taking one pill first thing in the morning holds me most of the day; though I often begin to get some acid in the evening. ,As far as I can tell; there are no side effects. I have heard things about these proton inhibitors doing something to the bones; though; making for bone problems; but there's no way I can tell whether it's happening to me. My bone situation has actually improved while on this medication because I've been working out in the gym with weights.,The simplicity is one of the best features. I take the pill with a glass of water first thing in the morning; wait at least 1/2 an hour before eating anything; and I'm done!

But it is now requiring 2 doses per day.  I take the 2nd pill not for burn but for congestion that builds up in my throat.,So far I have had no side effects.  I have been taking Omeprazole every day for a couple of years.  Although I have been prone to exhaustion the past couple of years.  The doctor(s) all swear it can have nothing to do with the omeprazole.  I would quit using it to find out if my heartburn didn't return so quickly and severely.,Take one pill before breakfast and one in the evening.

I also had overwhelming fatigue and even indigestion,This drug was fairly effective after one week's use week but did not cure the reflux completely and the side effects were very debilitating. I experienced a rebound effect after stopping which lasted for approximately four weeks. After having an endoscopy I was diagnosed with gastritis.

Therefore there was little of no chance of irritation of the esophagus.,Constipation and even less chance of digesting food properly.  ,Even though the reflux was kept under control I felt that constipation and poor digestion was a bad trade-off.  As there is bowel cancer in the family clearing of the large intestine is important to me.  I have now stopped taking the drug and prefer to treat the reflux by taking care of what I eat; how and when I eat; and being careful not to bend over too much after food.  I also use ginger tea which helps to regulate the stomach acid.

The pediatrician prescribed Singular each night and it has alleviated all his symptoms.  ,We have not seen any side effects.  He is not even made sleepy by this antihisitamine.,One tablet disolved in mouth before bed.  He dislikes the taste; but we solve that by taking his gummy vitamins immediately after the Singular.

After hearing about possible side effects on the News I stopped taking Singular; whiched ended the severe depression.,In the begining Singulair seem to work well controlling my allergies; however I slowly developed strong depression side effects. I've never had problems with depression before. The effects of the drug were slow and hard to notice any day to day change.

I have always had severe asthma and allergies and was hospitalized many times as a youngster.  I did have allergy shots which I truly think helped with my allergies.  When I got older; and inhaled cortisteroids were invented I started taking them; along with Singulair.  I was told that it was the "most benign medication that I was on" so I never thought twice about popping that small pill each day.  I suffered from frequent chest infections - that is a side effect of the singulair since it blocks the leuketrines that react and cause inflammation.  When I was 25; I started having severe mood swings and had to start taking an anti-depressant.  I continued the singulair without any thoughts.  However; after my third child; we were broke and I was trying to cut some medications down to save money and I stopped the singulair for a while.  I did notice that my asthma got worse so I figured oh well; have to start the Singulair again; that's when I started having the severe mood swings again.  I started doing some research online and read an article written by a mother who lost her son to suicide and attributed it to the singulair.  In my heart of hearts; I truly believe that more attention should be given to this drug; and it's affects on the brain.  I am no longer taking it and I am having much better luck with zyrtec.

Also I previously had a chronic cough/throat irritation prior to taking singulair and this is now gone. My asthma would act up when I drink or eat cold foods and this is no longer a problem. I haven't had bronchitis in over a year and would usually get 3-4 x  year. ,Did not notice any side effects. There are reports of depression as side effects but since I suffer from depression anyway it's hard to tell. Haven had any worsening of depression since starting singulair.,Singulair has been very beneficial in controlling my asthma and bronchitis. Do not notice it helps much with my allergies though. I do take zyrtec for allergies but if I run out and still taking the singulair my allerties come right back. When I miss a dose of singulair I notice my cough comes back right away.

Singulair significantly increased shortness of breath and fatigue--even during inactivity.  Due to the worsening of symptoms; I only took Singulair for two days.  Unfortunately; it took a few months before I was able to get back to my baseline (where I was prior to taking the drug).

If I forget to take it; I can tell that my breathing becomes more labored by about 36 hours after the last dose.  I will on occasion (maybe 1-2 times per week) need to use my rescue inhaler (albuterol); but it is primarily needed to ease discomfort and not to stop a full blown asthma attack.  In fact; I have not suffered a full blown asthma attack since I started taking Singulair.  ,There are no apparent side effects of Singulair for me.,My asthma had become so bad that when I was to be administered a test where I would be exposed to irritants to guage the severity of my asthma; I did not even get past the saline control before my breathing was adversely affected.  I would say that my experience with Singulair has been superior (only surpassed  by Advair; which I had to stop using due to the fact that my insurance company wouldn't cover it anymore.  That led to my change to Singulair.)

My daughter was prescribed this for mild asthma.  Doctors don't know or don't care about the dangerous; life-threatening side effects of this drug.  This is Merck's biggest money maker.

I had failed all the standard treatments; including high oral doses of prednisone.  I was facing a life on a ventilator with a tube in my throat.  Within a few days of starting this medication; I could breath. Actually breath.  You who have had severe asthma know how wonderful air can be. Within a week; I went for a walk.

Eyes and Skin less sensitive to sunlight. ,Extreme sleepiness (25mg feels like I took a Tylenol PM). Slight inability to concentrate. Depression of mood; slight irritability. I have noticed some suggest this is also prescribed for anxiety; I haven't noticed any reduction in anxiety; I have noticed if I'm irritated the irritability seems to last a bit longer than normal. It has done nothing to increase my motivation or productivity. ,I already have a low heart rate; so an hour after taking it I always take 200mg caffeine + 2 Primatene tablets (25mg Ephedrine HCL) to raise heartbeat while the Atenolol stabilizes it. The Ephedrine also helps to counteract sleepiness and depressed mood Atenolol causes in my system. I was going to quit taking it but over 2 months I have slowly experienced an increase in my health; before I was almost bed-ridden; now I can get up and walk around for extended periods of time. I originally had a bad case of Mono a few years back and it still showed in my system; he said it probably caused a bad case of Chronic Fatigue but it is not considered a real medical condition; so he wrote me a script for Atenolol after my EKG. They took 6 EKG's that read no heartbeat and the 7th read a supposedly impossible wave; I did every test from two separate doctors; they have no idea what it is.

During treatment for the headaches with frova and ketorolac I had an episode where I had sudden and severe pain in my head and felt like my head was going to explode; which sent me to the emergency room. The cause was never really determined but in the process it was noticed that my blood pressure was elevated and remained elevated during following doctor visits.  Since being on toprol; the headaches and blood pressure have remained managable throughout monthly hormonal changes.

I just thought I was getting sick with a virus. Then; as time went on; I started to also experience muscle soreness and tightness.

As soon as I quit taking the pills; all the bad symptoms cleared.  A few days later; I tried taking less (half); but; again started feeling bad.,As previously stated; because my cholesterol levels were high; the doctor said I should take Lipitor for one month and then we would retest the cholesterol levels to see if the medicine was effective in lowering the levels. But; because I was unable to take the Lipitor for the entire month; the  second  cholesterol test was never taken.  After taking the Lipitor for about 10 days; I stopped taking it.  A few days later; I did try to take just half a pill.  But within days; the side effects started to return.

Continue with exercise daily for at least 30 minutes each day.

Some of the side effects I experienced included chronic constipation; difficulty digesting food and sporadic stomach pain.  I found it difficult to enjoy eating food as I often felt a heavy feeling in my stomach after meals which was very unpleasant.,I took the Lipitor initially with morning meals and was not having a good result (regarding my digestion) so my doctor had me switch to taking it on an empty stomach; which did not seem to help much.  Overall; I am happy to not need this drug anymore.

I went from being extremely active to being unable to walk up a flight of stairs. It felt as though my knees would crumble under me.By the second week; I could barely walk up more than 3 steps. My doctor took me off the medication immediately; but the effects lasted about 6 months. ,My physician then tried a series of different medications for cholesterol. I was on Crestor; Simvastatin; and Zocor; all with the same side effect. My physician then ordered a lipid blood test to determine if the type of lipid found in my blood would promote cardiac disease; which thank goodness it didn't. I have a family history of elevated cholesterol: all the women in the family are on one of the cholesterol lowering medications: I am the only one in my family that experienced the above side effects.

This in my opinion is due to my thyroid condition., After several months with no side effects I suddenly had continuous bad muscular neck pain and stiffness (particularly at night) which got better when I stopped the statin. ,My cardiologist orginally prescribed atorvastatin and Omacor (at my asking about Omega 3 efficacy) due to my having a completed blocked artery in my heart (discovered on an ebt scan by my thyroid doc). I have since tried other statins but have not stayed on any of them very long due to lack of results in bringing down my LDL and side effects such as stomach pain.

Needed to keep my VLDLs low too.,No side effects,high cholesterol; 260; at menopause and 2 younger brothers with heart attacks in early 50s.  Both brothers had high blood VLDLs.  So took Lipitor to keep blood cholesterol levels down because of family history of high blood cholesterol on both maternal and paternal sides of family.

Night sweats and insomnia were making life difficult.  Immediately after starting the Climara patch; all menopausal symptoms were relieved.,I have not experienced any side effects except when dosage was increased.  Side effects then were acne and headaches.  Upon reducing the dosage to the current .025; all side effects were relieved.,Treatment entails applying one patch per week.
patient,53,female,menopausal,IBS; arthritis,Prometrium (progesterone),Climara (Estradiol) ,Anticholesteremic-Agents Estrogens Hormones Osteoporosis,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,.06 mg/day  taken once weekly for the period of 1 year+,Climara patch almost completely stopped the severe hot flashes and severe vaginal dryness. It also has improved skin tone and elasticity; moderated mood; improved sleep (by decreasing hot flash frequency). The side-effect of pain in liver area from estradiol by mouth has gone away using a dermal patch.,The only side effect from the Climara is mild itching after removing the patch. Another side effect is actually produced by the progesterone I have to take to balance the estrogen; and that is an aggravation of my IBS - abdominal pain; gas; bloating. So I take the progesterone only 7 days/month now and the side effects are minimal.,After being miserable with frequent (20+ times/day; 7-10 times/night) and severe hot flashes (sometimes like a sudden sunburn; skin turning red and burning) for a number of years; I went on hormone replacement therapy. Estrogen by mouth had more side effects; so I went on the patch; which I have to change only once a week. The recommended accompanying treatment of progesterone caused more problems than the estrogen: a combination patch which is available is more convenient; but I found by trying it that progesterone really aggravates my IBS symptoms. To lessen that effect; I went on an estrogen-only patch and use a separate progesterone only 7 days/month. This is currently making me have periods again; not a fun thing; but I feel much better overall because my IBS symptoms are much less severe and less frequent.

One month my local pharmacy was out of the trade brand and offered to fill the prescription with the generic brand and because I was in a hurry to catch a plane to go on a vacation; I agreed; thinking they had to be similar.  Wrong!  To begin with; the generic patch is twice the size and thickness of the trade brand - don't even think of wearing tight clothes while sporting one of these!  (I laughlingly told my husband we could always use one to patch a flat tire if needed; but soon it wasn't so funny.)  Within a day or two I knew something was wrong; but hadn't yet identified the problem.  I couldn't stop crying about nothing in particular.  It seemed as if overnight; my world had become very sad and depressing. I immediately began to gain weight; despite no change in my dietary habits.  After finally putting two and two together; I ripped it off and contacted my local pharmacist to see if anyone else had complained of similar experiences.  After rechecking my prescription; the pharmacist noticed my physician had marked "no generics".  Apparently; he had a good reason for this choice as this was not his usual stance on generics.  The pharmacist refilled my prescription with the trade brand and all was quickly back to normal. I usually have no problem with genereic brands; but unfortunately; no more generic estradiol for me!

Very difficult keeping the patch on. I'm going to ask the Dr. for different type of patch. Heard Vivelle is smaller and stays on bettetr.

I called the manufacture (Bayer); they took down the lot number and said we are sorry.  They said they were going to send a new box to my local pharmacy at no charge.  I have checked every week for the last three weeks and NOTHING!  Yeah; great way to follow through.  Throughout being on the patch I noticed large acne on my face; lack of energy; no libido; vaginal dryness; daily hot flashes and extreme moodiness (so sorry to my husband; even though he has been great through all of this).  I know it has only been three months and my body is trying to adjust; but I just could not take it anymore.  I contacted my GYN and he prescribed Estratest.  Cross your fingers I hope it works!!!!,---
patient,51,female,hot flash sleep problems,hypothyroidism,synthroid,Climara (Estradiol) ,Anticholesteremic-Agents Estrogens Hormones Osteoporosis,8,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,.05 mg.  taken patch changed weekly for the period of 3 years,My moods have improved dramatically.  I would wake at least 3 times a night and have difficulty going back to sleep (sleep was always a problem); but now sleep is much better.  Hot flashes were intense and distracting; and have since stopped.  I originally took Premarin which gave me headaches.  The patch and it's consistent delivery has helped immensely to reduce number and severity of headaches.,The only drawback to using the patch is a mild allergy to the adhesive.  Sometimes the patch slips and has come off several times in the bath; so I've had to pull out a new one.  I do not like having to take progesterone separately in pill form; or at all; but with a uterus it is necessary.  I'm also concerned about long-term effects.,I originally began using HRT 5 years ago to help with very severe menopausal symptoms.  I had tried all the natural remedies as I was very concerned about taking a medication:  herbs; soy; etc.  I walked 30 miles a week and did yoga; none of which helped.  In desperation I visited my OB GYN who suggested I go on HRT; stating that quality of life needed to be considered.  Shortly; thereafter; the reports initial study was released; and again I spoke to my doctor who said that she thought the results were over inflated.  I switched to estradiol because it's considered more effective; and the patch bypasses the liver with delivery directly through the skin.  I've since weaned myself off several times; only to have the symptoms return.  I'm concerned about latest studies and have thought about weaning myself off again; and then think; "quality of life".

It is awful.  I will contact my doc today.  Could the change from Climara to the generic cause this?

This is not a side effect per se; but it is something to be aware of--the patch leaves a dirty/darkened ring around it on the skin due to normal body oils. Even though I am a heavy shower-taker (but also work out a lot; therefore I produce above average perspiration); no one mentions this but it is unsightly. ,Application of one patch in abdomen or upper buttock area weekly.

It helped for these issues.,The main side effects I experienced with Climara were bloating; weight gain and indigestion/gas. I gained 8 pounds in two months! As soon as I stopped the drug; the bloating and gas disappeared; and my weight gain is returning to normal. ,Climara is meant to be used with a complementary progesterone subscription. I took  it in pill form. Now I am planning to try Amberen; a natural supplement which is supposed to balance the endocrine system. Got my fingers crossed!

My HDL (good cholesterol) numbers were up and the LDLs (bad cholesterol) went down. My triglycerides were lowered as well.,I have not experienced any side effects from this medication.,I had a heart scan after experiencing exercise-induced arrhythmia. One artery had 20-30% blockage; while the others were clear. Crestor and low dose aspirin were prescribed as an "aggressive form" of treatment. The cardiologist was very pleased with the results after only a month's trial. I would recommend Crestor to anyone contemplating statin treatment.

Cardiac catheterization was done and 60% blockage  found. 1 Year after that;more angina; another cath. and no change in blockage was found.,I did not experience any side effects and still continue that way. During the first year; my doctor was running labs every 3 months and at no time were any abnormalities noticed. He continues to do labs at 6 month intervals now and as of last one(3 weeks ago); still no problems noticed.,Began dose at 20 mg/day and have remained at that dose for 3.5 years. During that first year I also made some nutritional modifications. I recognize now that it was a half-hearted effort; but the combination still provided very good results.As of today; my cholesterol numbers have gotten even better. total CHOL.=102  TRI=49  LDL=55 and HDL=37(started @38).I had lapband surgery 3 months ago and have made dramatic changes in nutrition in addition to the medication.

My cholesterol has always been high during routine blood tests but around a year ago it had risen to 8 mmol/l (almost 300 ml/dl)and my HDL/LDL ratio was poor. Trigylserides were normal before taking Crestor after weight loss.,Surprisingly no side effects with Crestor even though it is the most potent of the statins. I had severe muscle pains with Lipitor and other statins and expected to have the same problems with Crestor. For some reason I didn't have these problems with Crestor.,I was started on 10mg and retested after 10 weeks. My LDL (bad cholesterol) dropped significantly; HDL rose slightly and triglyserides dropped slightly (they were already in the normal range before). My liver enzymes were high before taking Crestor but had returned to normal when retested after 10 weeks (I don't know if Crestor had anything to do with this or not). Blood sugar levels were normal before and after taking Crestor; but slightly lower after. I am due to be tested again before the end of this year and also have a Cardio Stress Test. After a new doctor reviewed my medical history; he suggested I have a stress test even though I still haven't experienced any symptoms of heart disease. All ECG results at rest have been normal.

My triglyceride levels were reduced as well.,One side effect my doctor warned me to watch for was loss of muscle density.  I work out with weights usually three times a week.  I noticed no loss of muscle size; tone; or strength while taking Crestor.,Because my LDL cholesterol was in the "high risk" range by American Heart Assn. standards; it was important to lower my risk level quickly.  In addition to taking 5 mg. of Crestor daily; I made disciplined adjustments to my diet.  I cut out animal fats; including dairy fats (like cheese and ice cream).  I cut out trans fats (like partially hydrogenated oils).  I greatly increased my consumption of wheat bran and oat bran; and raw vegetables.  I also took 500 mg. of time-release Niacin with my lunch each day.  Once I got my LDL cholesterol down to below 100 mg/dL; my doctor revised my prescription to only 2.5 mg. Crestor per day.  Since Crestor is not sold in this dosage; I must cut the pills in half.  I was tested again after 60 days at this dosage; and my LDL was still below 100 mg/dL.  And that was with a more relaxed diet.

I felt that I had aged about twenty years in a few months!,I lucked out finding the answer in an online newsletter that warned Crestor users of this problem which the manufacturer claimed was "very rare".

I had a hystirectomy a year before I was put on the hormones. I say an increase in wrinkles in that first year. I can not say that I have seen a slowing in the aging process but I am sleeping better and that of course will bennefit the skin.,I have not experienced any side effects to my knowledge. I feel as if an increase in the dose would maybe last longer as I seem to be waking at least once a night with a hot flash. I take it in the morning so maybe by the time I hit the sheets it is out of my system. I do not miss a day and always take it at the same time each morning. ,As I stated I had a hystirectomy at 50 years old. I went over a year w/out any homone treatment and the hot flashes got so severe I was waking about 5 to 6 times a night. I was using over the counter sleep aids and did not like them. I got the doctor to prescribe the hormones and the benefits were almost immediate. I have been on the same dose for over a year now and feel I might benefit from an increased dose. I am 54 now and am looking not quite my age but the aging process is speeding up I feel.

Since taking it; the flashes and mood swings disappeared.  I have been on hormaone therapy for about 20 years and have no intention of going off.  I feel good and look good for my age and I attribute some of that to the hormonal therapy.

Also regulated menstrual cycle length and helped relieve acne.  The best part is that you only menstruate 4 times a year; as opposed to 12 or 13.,During the first two months or so that I was on Seasonique; I experienced rather severe depression and uncontrollable mood swings.  I also had issues with breast swelling and tenderness.  I spoke with my doctor and he advised me that such side effects; although very uncommon; almost always wore off after the first few months.  I decided to stick it out and sure enough; they wore off as my body grew accustomed to the medication.,You take one pill every day; preferably at around the same time.

I had to take a sick day off from work because I felt so sick: headache; constantly feeling hot and cold; extreme tiredness.  I also started breaking out a lot and my skin started to be so dry.  My husband also has said that I've had some mood swings as well.,shouldn't have been on any BC to begin with.  Afterall; I shouldn't complain--my periods are always on time like clock work.  No cramps; only the occasional bloating.  I started to be on BC to prevent pregnancy; but I'll just be more careful by using a condom instead.

After i switched to seasonique a few weeks ago; i lost my appetite and lost weight. I dont eat nearly as much now. Im 5'0'' and before i switched i used to weigh roughly around 115... now im sticking around 105. i have no experience with the bad side effects with seasonique,none,one pill a day at the same time

I have naturaly good skin; and do not break out often at all. Seasonique made me break out quite a bit. I am not taking seasonique for another 3 months.,Seasonique is taken once a day at the same time for 3 months.

The reason I have used it this long is because despite the side effects of continuous breakthrough bleeding; I have been away at school and unable to visit my doctor for anew prescription. I am sexually active and did not want to take myself off birth control. DO NOT TAKE SEASONIQUE. For the first two months everything was OK; minus occasional extreme cramps. But I am on my third month of my third pack; and I have had breakthrough bleeding for TWENTY FIVE DAYS now. This does not only scare me in health areas; but it is making me extremely depressed. ,N/A
patient,20,female,Birth Control,Nausea; Vomiting; Mood Swings; Weight Gain; Spotting,None. ,Seasonique ,Anticholesteremic-Agents Contraceptives Estrogens,3,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,1 Pill a Day  taken once a day for the period of For 3 months,Well; I didnt have any babies; so I guess Seasonique did its job. My pimples cleard up. ,Horrible HORRIBLE nausea for the first month or so. And I would vomit almost everyday; whether I ate something or not; it didnt matter; it was coming up. Sometimes eatting something would help; and sometimes I actually didnt throw up. But if I didnt eat anything; then it was guarenteed I would be paying a visit to my good friend: the toilet. I would usually take my pill at 8 in the morning; and the nausea would finally end around 3pm. This happned EVERYDAY. But around month 2 is where it would be ok; till month three; where I would have light spotting; then it would get heavier and heavier till it was as if I was having a full blown period.,is not bad; perhaps it was just me with the horrible side effects; but I will probably never take this ever again. 
patient,21,female,birth control,none,none,Seasonique ,Anticholesteremic-Agents Contraceptives Estrogens,5,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1 pill  taken 1 pill every day for the period of 3 MONTHS,I thought the benefits would be one period every 3 months; pregnancy prevention; regulated periods. I also read that they would be lighter and shorter and help with acne. WRONG!,Well I was quite leary about starting Seasonique; I was already taking Yaz and I loved it; but 4 periods a year why pass that up. From the moment I started taking it; it wasn't a decreased sex drive; I had none at all; which made the birth control completely useless to me. In addition to that; the acne just kept getting worse; I didn't have acne to begin with besides the occasional blemish here and there. It started getting worse on my face; then my chest; then my back; (it's not just one here or one there; my back; chest; and chin are seriously covered) I've even had one on my ribs! Crazy! My boobs no longer fit into my bras; even some shirts. It was like they doubled in size overnight (not a huge problem; just annoying with no explanation). I went out and bought a bra; a week later it didn't even cover my boobs. Lastly; I've been fretting the last 2 weeks because I still haven't gotten my period! I never had a problem with my periods showing up in the past; they've always been lighter and not very long; pretty ideal actually. The Dr. said I would bleed between... still not bleeding! I've taken 3 pregnancy tests; wasted 10 bucks on each! Oh yeah; I've been crying for no reason at all the last month. I started crying over some lady I didn't even know at work. I do not recommend taking Seasonique. I know it must be expensive although I don't know how much because my Dr. gave me sample packs and I'm not going to bother refilling it. Also they give you a coupon for $50 off and $25 off the next refill; if they are giving that much off it must be a lot. It wasn't terrible; just nothing was expected (and I still have no clue as to why I haven't gotten a period yet). I've tried several other birth control pills and never had any side effects with any of them. This is the first time I tried one where I only get a period every three months so maybe those are way different or something. If you are looking for a good pill; Yaz worked great for me and I never had any breakthrough bleeding; mood swings; loss of sex drive; acne or anything. Hope this helps.,1 pill every day for 12 weeks; then 1 week of period pills
patient,24,female,Birth Control,n/a,none,Seasonique ,Anticholesteremic-Agents Contraceptives Estrogens,6,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,1 Tablet by mouth  taken once a day; everyday for the period of One month,Fewer periods; a big plus for any woman.,Spotting between periods (started off heavy like a period; but lightened up as time progressed); breast tenderness (do to fluid build-up);  breasts became larger in size (once more; do to fluid build-up); and bloating.,Although the beginning stages of taking the pill were somewhat uncomfortable; Seasonique has remained a staple in modern birth control.  I would suggest this medication to any woman that is tired of dealing with a period every month (which is the majority of us).  The only thing that you need to keep an eye on; besides taking the pill everyday; is when its time for your cycle ITS THERE!  Even though you're on the pill does not mean you still can't get pregnant.  Take tests every three weeks to ensure there are no surprises in store for you.

I started taking the pill because I wouldn't stop bleeding after having my daughter.  My doctor prescribed another type of pill and it stopped it immediately.  So after my next appointment; I told him I wanted something more permanent and seasonique was the answer.,breakthrough bleeding.  I took seasonique for nine months and had 20 days of breakthrough bleeding every three months.  It didn't matter if I took the pill everyday at the same time or took one later or even skipped one; it was always 20 days of breakthrough bleeding (at the least; 20 days).  The last straw was starting the end of July and still having breakthrough bleeding on my birthday at the end of August.  And to make matters worse; starting my period three days after it finally stopped!,Stopped taking the pill and asked for something else.

My doctor told me i would probably still get my period around those times; just very light. However i did not get any spotting for three months; i got my period a week ago and it's getting worse. The cramps on a scale of 1 to 10 are at 11; and it went from very light to heavy. I'm not even at the end of the pack yet! I don't recommend seasonique. I was told to take motrin; that hasn't even helped. I've felt like i'm in labor for a week now.,I was actually rushed to the hospital last night because the cramps were so severe. All day i felt a little pain now and then; however towards the end of the day it got unbearable. I was sitting in the air conditioning and i started to feel really hot out of nowhere; had difficulty breathing; nausea; and felt like i was literally about to faint. I'm going to try to get off this pill and try something else as soon as i can!

Switched to Seasonique since there are hormones in the last week of pills which my doctor thought might reduce headaches.  Nope.  After the first three months I had my period and had the same terrible migraines.  I gave it three more months but had the same results.  The good news?  Not pregnant. ,I experienced a number of side effects without even connecting it to the pill.  Once I read about all the side effects online it was an "ah ha" moment.  Weight gain --I am a runner and eat well and I have gained 10 pounds in six months.  I workout 5-6 times a week and didn't change my diet and couldn't figure it out.  I look forward to losing those extra lbs!  Acne --TERRIBLE acne.  I've never had a problem with my skin and my face exploded.  I had big cysts on my cheeks.  I also experienced night sweats.  I cannot recommend Seasonique.,One pill a day at the same time each day.

I am very active; work out - resistance training and cardio.  The hunger and the weight gain and water retention did NOT work with my lifestyle.,I wouldn't take this pill if you are susecptible to depression or anxiety; or if you are a fitness-minded person and care how you feel in your clothes.  Very expensive as well. My health insurance doesn't cover scripts; and even with a $50 coupon from my OB/GYN; I still paid $160!

However; I had always experienced heavy periods and cramping; even after trying 3 different birth controls so I decided to give it a try. My doctor assured me that Seasonique was safe and I shouldn't have any severe side effects. After only a couple weeks; I started experiencing headaches and extreme breast tenderness. I didn't think much of it at first; but then I started experiencing more side effects. I have been blessed with great skin; only having a few pimples throughout my lifetime. However; after being on Seasonique for about a month; I started to notice my skin was frequently breaking out. I didn't want to stop taking birth control; so I figured I would give it a little bit longer to adjust to my body. About a month and a half into taking Seasonique; I began to breakthrough bleed. I had a full blown period for exactly 3 weeks. I consulted my doctor about a week into the period and she assured me it was totally normal. While on Seasonique; I could definitely feel significant changes in my body that were not normal for me. For these reasons; I would NOT recommend Seasonique to anyone.

The aspirin worked well; I can take the Niaspan with no problems.,My treatment includes statin drugs and Niaspan because normal diet and exercise were not sufficient to keep my cholesterol level down.

I would like to use HRT forever.,I apply a patch about every 4 days; even though my gynecologist recommended one every 3 because my prescription plan will only pay for one pack per month; which only contains 8 patches. Hello! That only covers 24 days. Do they not know that there are at least 30 days in a month?!  By the time the fourth day arrives; I find myself feeling more irritable.  My husband will even notice and say to me; "Did you change your patch recently"? He even notices how much more 'even keeled' I am with it.I used the .1mg patch for 3 and a half years; then went to the .075mg patch for 1 and a half years; and have now been on the .05mg patch for 6 months.  The only reason I tapered it was because of the concerns listed in the research and upon advisement of my physician. I prefer the 1mg patch and would like to use it until I die!  I apply the patch just below my waistline on the left side of my hip area; then when I change it I place the new one in the same area on my right side. It's easy; simple and so-o-o-o- effective!

There is no history of breast cancer in my immediate family (grandmothers/mother/sister),Started out on a .1 mg patch and worked down to a .075 patch.... doc wanted me to go lower; but when I do I get some night sweats and can tell the difference so I am staying on the .075 = my hormone levels in my blood are normal for a woman my age on HRT.

I am currently in the process of reducing my dose to see if sleep habits improve; but lab values remain at good levels,As I mentioned above; my diagnosis was based almost exclusively on labratory tests.  TSH and T4 (thyroid hormone) were found to be too high and too low; respectively.  Relatively non-descript symptoms accompanied the list of complaints at the time of diagnosis.  These symptoms improved somewhat after treatment.  It is still to be determined if side effects will be improved on reduced dosage.

I take the one pill of each one first thing in the morning with lots of water before eating anything.  I have to wait 30 minutes before I eat breakfast.  The hardest part is that I have to wait 2 hours before I take any calcium pills; which means I often forget to take my calcium.

I had other symptoms such as small weight gain; hair thinning; very tired and slept allot.  The doctor originally thought that I simply had depression so she prescribed an anit-depressant.  After about a year things still were not right.  So she did a thyroid panel.  She quicky got me on a regular dosage and the panic and depression went away along with most of the other symptoms.,No side affects from the treatment that I can think of.,Take one pill first thing in the morning on an empty stomach and wait at least an hour to eat.

Further; medication was taken during pregnancy with no apparent ill effects to the fetus; and with the benefit of carrying to term with none of the adverse effects associated with hypothyroidism and pregnancy.  ,Did not note any side effects.,Treatment of hypothyroidism is simple: one pill per day provides the thyroid hormones lacking.  Furthermore; brand-name drugs are inexpensive; even when paid for out of pocket.

Was having a weight issue; and with a blood test it was determined that the thyroid gland was "sluggish".  I was very exhausted also and it has helped somewhat with fatigue.,dosing is extremely important as it takes many blood tests to determine correct dosage.  Not having the dosage quite right will basically result in the same symptoms that you are having issues with.  I have suffered basically no significant side effects other than that.,Pill is taken early in the morning on an empty stomach.  It is basically prescription iodine as hypothyroidism is basically an iodine deficiency.  Symptoms that I experienced were basically weight gain and extreme fatigue.  It's taken awhile to get the dosage correct; and after switching pharmacies and getting a different drug manufactured by another company; I feel that maybe another blood test is necessary to confirm that the new pills are as effective as the others I had been taking for 5 years.

While hypothyroid I gained weight; had hair loss; was fatigued; cold and miserable.  Getting on a correct dose of thyroid replacement is great.  My hair returned; I became more fit and active.,When on too much levothyroxine I was jittery; had weight loss and was emotional.  If I had too little I had difficulty with bloating and fatigue.  It was certainly a drug that had to be monitored and adjusted based on lab levels and side effects.,I began replacement with 250mcg each day.  I rather quickly had difficulty with rapid heart rate; dry hair and skin; emotionalness that wasn't true to me.  It took several months of monitoring blood levels of thyroid hormone; monitoring syptoms and adjusting doses to find a right dose for me.  I've been stable on my current dose for 3 years.

Now it is growing back and getting thicker.  Before I was always cold and my hands would even get numb from being so cold all the time.  Now I am finally warm and don't have to wear a sweater  in the summer.,After I take it in the morning I feel nauseous unless I eat something when I take it.  It is recommended to be taken on an empty stomach; so sometimes I do this; but feel queasy for an hour or so.,This is something that I will probably continue to take.  Even though it makes me a bit nauseous; the benefits greatl outweigh the risks for me.  It is so nice to be able to be warm again; and for my hair to be growing back.

ABSOLUTELY HORRIBLE results relating to depression; weight gain; pain in joints & muscles; and fatigue.,Difficult to maintain effective absorption because I also have to take antacids for Barrett's esophagus.  Why; since absorption is so critical; is there not a patch administration for this medication?  Also experience heart palpitations.,Initial dosage 15 years ago was 150 micrograms/day.  Increased steadily for first 5 years to 300 micrograms/day.  Has remained at 300 micrograms per day for last 10 years.
patient,38,female,Thyroid Disease,None,None,Levoxyl (Levothyroxine) ,Anticoagulants Anticoagulants Antineoplastics-Cancer-Treatments Antineoplastics-Cancer-Treatments Antithyroid-Agents Antithyroid-Agents Coagulants Coagulants Hormones Hormones,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,150 mcg  (dosage frequency: 1 x day)  for the period of 8 yrs.,The benefits I received from treatment with this Unihroid drug was that my thyroid hormone levels fell back within normal range according to the many thyroid hormone profile blood tests; TSH; T3 etc. which was ordered by thyroid specialist. Another benefit from Unithroid drug was that the goiter which I had developed prior to Unithroid treatment which had become increasingly larger had finally gone down to the point that my neck actually looked normal again.,My freaking hair has fallen out to the point that I am almost bald in front and around the front edges of my hair. My hair has been falling out since I began treatment with Unithroid and continues to shed today. My hair is practically bald in front and the hair on the the top and back of my head has fallen out so much that the once extremely thick hair I had is now thin; and breaks easily. From the hundreds of complaints I keep reading from other thyroid patients on the web; it appears that I am not alone in my dilemma; but to date; myself and the other hundreds of thyroid patients complaining of the same problem have yet to find a safe natural hair product to grow back hairloss from thyroid disease. Other side effects are sometimes depending on what I eat or the time of day; my pulse starts racing.,Not sure theres much to describe. I had a noticeable goiter and went to get it checked. My previous thyroid doctor gave me an iodine uptake scan; took my bloodwork and diagnosed me with Hashimotos disease. Thyroid doctor said the best thing was to let my thyroid burn itself out and then he would put me on thyroid medicine; something I now feel was a mistake and should not have been done. Per my initial thyroid doctor; Hashimotos is sometimes hard to stabilize; thus; the Unithroid drug dosage I initially received .75 mcg had to be re-adjusted several times during the first year in order to stabilize my thyroid levels. Dosage was increased to 100 mcg. then to 125 mcg. then increased to 150 mcg. At some point; during these adjustments I went to another thyroid doctor who prescribed the T3 drug called Cytomel which gave me violent heart palpitations and I was taken off of this drug. The last Unithroid prescription dosage re-adustment I was given was for 150 mcg. 1xday 6 days wk with 1/2 dosage to be taken on Sundays. Medication to be taken on an empty stomach every morning. Last year; my body became Toxic to the Unithroid as I hadn't been to see the doctor in a while and had to be taken off the medication entirely for several days. Was restarted at a low dose of 50 mcg. because the toxicity had caused my pulse to race abnormally interupting my daily activities. This dosage was gradually increased I am now being treated with a Unithroid dosage of 125 mcg. For whatever reason; this survey is being taken; it would be a blessing to myself and so many others if for once someone would develop a natural alternative to drugs like Unithroid; Synthroid etc. other than the natural alternatives on the market that are derived from Pigs glands considering more people than not today do not intake pork products of any kind.

Six months ago I developed panic attacks;speediness;anxiety;gastric issues;dizziness very suddenly with a sudden drop in my TSH from a steady 1.8-2.0 to as low as .20.  Continued to take the Levoxyl but dropped dosage back to 50mcg and hope to become asymtomatic shortly. Take Xanax for the panic attacks as needed. Am hoping to perhaps supplement the T4 with T3 Cytomel or something for the depression.,See above,Above

I feel like a new person in just 5 days.  More energy; more positive; sugar cravings stopped. Over all feel 100% better.  As far as I am concerned that Dr. took 6 years out of my life. New Female Dr. finally put me back on Armour.  It was unavailable for almost a year. I think it was all about money. Armour is less costly and moree effective.,Levoxyl did nothing for me. I felt flat. lack of energy and spirit.,grew back and did not feel like my self. Back on Armour for just 5 days and feel so much better. INSIST ON GETTING ARMOUR. FORGET LEVOXYL AND SYTHROID.

Since I can't find a Dr. who will treat my T3 I'm ordering Cytomel online; from what I've read it's the ticket to eliminate hypo symptoms.

Doctor did not see the connection between cough and Synthroid;(chest Xray came back fine) however as it did bother my stomach briefly at time of dosing; I decided it might be affecting the stomach lining. Recently towards late afternoon or before retiring will take Tagamet or some generic stomach med. I DO NOT experience heartburn; however; this routine seems to reduce the embarrassing cough significantly. This was my own resolution after trying many allergy medicines once or twice which did not stop the cough at all. Was also given sample of Advair which I did not use due to negative side effects I read about on internet before using. I am seeking a more natural and effective solution to replace the Synthroid with something that will treat source of low thyroid as well as the symptoms.

When proper levels are achieved; the endocrine system operates as it should. Important to note that generic versions CAN NOT be substituted if patient is currently treated with name brand. Start on generic; stay on generic. Start on Synthroid; stay on Synthroid. This is common knowledge among endocrinologists and pharmacists; but your insurance company may interfere.,Provided annual blood tests are administered to check thyroid levels; there are no side effects and ensures healthy operation of endocrine system. ,Treatment includes annual blood test to monitor thyroid levels; adjust dosage if necessary; and annual check-up with endocrinologist or internist.

It is a tightrope balancing act and the blood work is not specific enough to guide the clinical course. ,Compared to others who naturally have a functioning thyroid; it is clear to see that Synthroid is an inferior product to what the thyroid makes naturally in a healthy individual. I know that I still have minor hypothyroid symptoms even when my blood counts show that I have therapeutic levels of the medication. Additionally; generic versions of Synthroid seem to be even less effective at relieving all the symptoms; even though the blood counts could be normal. With hypothyroidism becoming a very common condition these days; one would think that new medications would be coming out; but the medical professionals seem content to stick with Synthroid because "on paper" it seems to be safe and effective.

I gained weight rapidly and didn't know why.  After taking a blood test; it was determined that my thyroid level was low.  Once taking the medicine; my blood tests came back ok; but the weight did not decrease as the doctor had said it would.,There have been no side effects to my knowledge.  I do realize that if I do not take the medicine as indicated that I get tired more frequently and feel slugish.  I am concerned that there may be a better alternative to taking synthroid.  I have heard of medicine that can be taken in two pill form and that may better correct the thyroid imbalance.,I take one pill everyday at the same time.

I exhibited classic symptoms of hypo-thyroid; but did not check out as such in the standard blood test.  A new doctor understands that not every person will fall within "standard" test results.  God bless her.  The results were rapid and positive with an increase in energy; loss of about 10 pounds of excess weight.

I have had a very difficult time getting traditional Dr.s to look beyond the Thyroid and to realize that for a woman it becomes a package deal. Once you hit menopause and the chemical balance shifts it is not enough to look at one part of the body and blame that for all your symptoms. I was NEVER sick as a child or young adult. I never had female problems; but once menopause set in my body went haywire. I KNOW; in speaking with women my own age;that I am not an isolated case. Thyroid disease is more prevalent than ever and this drug does not cut it for some patients. ,One pill every morning 1 hour before breakfast. Just recently instructions have included not taking vitamins with Calcium 2 hrs after the pill; but this has not made a difference.

Sometimes I can only wait 30 minutes and it does not seems to alter the effect of the medication.

I have more energy; and feel like myself again.    ,I never had any side effects.  The only drawback is that you have to take the medication on an empty stomach or wait three hours after you eat.  However; they prefer you take it in the morning.  So what I do is keep my medicaton next to my bed and take it the very first time I wake up in the morning whether it's 4; 5; or 6 am.    ,I returned from vacation in August by November I had gained 14 pounds.  I did not know why.  I was eating the same amount of food.  I went to see the doctor and after a complete check up and blood tests they found I had a low under active thyroid.  As I think back; I did feel more tired; I did not want to join my kids and spouse to do anything instead I would go to bed early.  That is not like me.  I am the type of person who would get up and go anytime.  I thought I was just tired.  Now; I reflect and remember that I stopped doing things with my family; became less active and all along I thought it was because I was tired when in actuality my thyroid was off.

Because I had thyroid cancer the entire thyroid was removed.  Since thyroid hormone keeps the body running at optimum speed; it is now essential for me to take medication that will accomplish what my body is no longer capable of doing on its own.     ,There have been no treatment side effects for me thus far.,Treatment consists simply of taking a 100 mcg Synthroid pill each morning.  This should be taken on an empty stomach and no food should be taken for one full hour.  It is also important not to take any calcium supplement for four hours after taking Synthroid.  Calcium interferes with the body's ability to effectively utilize the Synthroid.

Blood work required every 6 months in order to help ensure proper dosage.

I have a blood test every year and after the initial experimenting with the dosage which started at .50 my thyroid levels are normal.,There are no side effects that I have noticed.,I was surprised when informed by my doctor that my thyroid level was low.

Had to continually change dosage. The medication for hyperthyroid also can cause birth defects. I was anticipating having children within a few years. I went in and had the radio active iodine. After one month my thyroid was destroyed. Had tried generic brands of synthroid but was still expereincing changes in my thyroid level. My doctor perscribed only name brand syntroid and it has been at a cosistant level for at least 5 years. ,When taking synthroid it must be taken on an empty stomach around the same time every day. Multivitamins with Iron decrease the sythroids effectiveness so they must be taken at least 3 hours after taking sythroid. Never miss a dosage. I once missed a few days in a row and became very depressed almost suicidal. Will need to take sythroid for the rest of my life and keep regular appointments to have my thyroid levels checked.,The radio active iodine treatment was conducted as outpatient surgery at the local hospital. I was given a pill to swallow. I was then asked to come back after 6 hours to have a scan done of my thyroid. I came back the next day for another scan. After one week I had a blood test and was perscribed synthroid. I have my thyroid checked on an annual basis. In some cases depending on any changes in my thyroid levels I have had to go back on a six month check up schedule.

I experienced more benefit from exercise than from taking this mandatory drug.,I experienced weight gain fluctuations and loss of energy. I complained to several doctors over the period of 20 years without effect. There is no alternative treatment if the patient does not feel the benefit. The doctor only sees the blood test to show that the treatment is effective.,No treatment; other than taking a blood test every 6 months to see if the level was correct; regardless of the side effects. I found this offensive since I clearly gained 20 pounds when on the medication than when I was not on the medication (or the dosage was reduced).

Before the medication; my skin was horribly dry and flaky. The changes did not take place overnight. I would say that it took about 3-4 months to see any improvement in my hair and skin. ,I really experienced very few side effects; if any.  Initially; they started me off on a very low dosage because they just thought it was simply hypothyroidism but after a blood test; they realized that I has Hashimooto's thyroidities and moointored it more closely.

I do have excessive sweating but they aren't sure if that is the synthroid or menopause and the doctors don't really seem concerned.,Initially I was being treated for high blood pressure and put on topral but they did a TSH test and realized that something was wrong with my thyroid. I was originally started off on a very low dosage ( 12.5 mcg/daily) and had to keep going back for blood work every month. Slowly they increased it until they did another test and found out that it was Hashimoto's thyroiditis.

However after 2 years of taking Synthroid and endocrinologist unwilling to try alternative medication; I found another doctor who did some additional testing.  She found that I was low in Free t3 & t4 and the prescribed Armour thyroid.  I feel much better on this thyroid replacement than I did using Synthroid.
patient,65,female,low thyroid production,Graves disease,none,Synthroid (Levothyroxine) ,Anticoagulants Antineoplastics-Cancer-Treatments Antithyroid-Agents Coagulants Hormones,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,112 mcg  (dosage frequency: one daily)  for the period of since 1991,I had Graves disease in 1990 which indicated that my thyroid function was way too high.  The symptoms were anxiety; sleeplessness; depression and restlessness. I was administered an uptake test and I received radioactive iodine therapy to slow down my thyroid function.  This threw me into a state of low thyroid function.  Synthoid balances my thyroid function to normal and the negative symptoms disappeared.,None,See my description under "treatment benefits"
patient,31,female,hypothyriod,none,none,Synthroid (Levothyroxine) ,Anticoagulants Antineoplastics-Cancer-Treatments Antithyroid-Agents Coagulants Hormones,1,Ineffective,No Side Effects,90 mg  taken once daily for the period of a day,none; I was very disappointed at the time because the doctor said that it going to take care of my problem. I had no energy.,It just didn't work and that was the side affects.,I was put on synthroid to cure a slow thyroid. It did not help and I discontinued use. I was changed to Armour Thyroid and have had fabulous results with it. Armour Throid is what was giving to before the drug companies came out with a synthetic version of it.
patient,63,female,low thyroid,none,none,Synthroid (Levothyroxine) ,Anticoagulants Antineoplastics-Cancer-Treatments Antithyroid-Agents Coagulants Hormones,1,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,200 mcg  (dosage frequency: 1 time per day)  for the period of 10 years,The synthroid medication did; for most of the ten years while I took it; keep my thyroid levels where they were supposed to be.  ,After taking this synthroid medication for a period of about 10 years; here is what happened.  We were on vacation in another state and all of a sudden I began to feel extremely horrible-- very weak; with a rapid heart beat.  We were getting ready to get on an airplane and come home.  So I thought if I can just get to my home town and get to a hospital; they can surely figure out what is wrong with me.  We arrived at our home airport and then we went straight to the emergency room; where they ran several tests and I was there for several hours; but they could find nothing wrong with me.  So they told me to go to my regular doctor the next day; which I did of course and he ran a blood test and found that it was the thyroid medication that was causing my problems.     ,was wonderful to get off of a prescription medication.  I hope this information may be helpful to someone out there.

Slight weight gain.  ,Due to the hunger feeling...  I have breakfast when I wake up and I take the Levothyroxine 2 hours after breakfast with a full glass of water.  The hunger feeling has become less.

My hair is now thick and shiny again.  I did not have weight gain so I cannot comment on that.,I did not experience any side effects.  My doctor is very hesitant to give me the generic version as there are many cmplaints that the generic version does not relive symptoms.,I take one pill every morning with a very large glass of water.  I must wait one hour before eating or drinking anything but water.  I take this pill at the same time every morning and it took about 2 to 3 weeks to begin feeling better.  I must get regular; every 3months; bloodwork to check thyroid levels.
patient,63,female,Underactive thyroid,mild hypoglycemia,currently plavix; lipitor; none 15 yrs ago,Synthroid (Levothyroxine) ,Anticoagulants Antineoplastics-Cancer-Treatments Antithyroid-Agents Coagulants Hormones,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,Currently .112 mcg.  Dose has increased.  (dosage frequency: once per day)  for the period of 15 years; still taking it,Stabilized and regulated the levels of thyroxin in my body.,None.,One pill per day; standard. I'd like to point out that the Brand Name drug works fine; but the generic versions are not as good. I have had the same problem with some other drugs (primarily antibiotics)where the generic was not effective but the brand name product worked fine.
patient,66,female,hypothyroidism,None,Hormone replacement therapy ,Tirosint (Levothyroxine) ,Anticoagulants Antithyroid-Agents Coagulants Hormones,6,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,.100 MG  taken once a day for the period of 8 years,It seemed to stabilize my metabolism.  ,I didn't seem to see any and was frequently not sure if I was actually getting the right dose.  It took about 3 years to get the current dose right.  And since that time I haven't changed it.  I have found out that the dosage I am taking is the very least amount I can take and still take thyroid medicine.  ,I take one thyroid pill a day.  I did originally take Synthyroid; but changed to the generic brand about 5 years ago to save on total costs.  Since I have been on generic brands; the shape of the pill has changed.  Also; so has the directions on taking it.  Now I can hardly take it and have it be effective; because I have to take the pill on an empty stomach; with a full glass of water; in the morning; and I can't have anything that might interfere with its absorption for 4 hours -- such as food; vitamins; or any other medicine.  So I do not know if it is effective or not; since I would have to try and take it in the middle of the night.  I am not going to do that; so I take it at night before going to sleep --- without a full glass of water.

I was diagnosed with hypothyroidism (TSH 14.5) this past December and evidence of an auto immune disorder.  Since; I have been on 50mcg daily; my TSH tests normal but  there has been no improvements in symptoms.

On the 75 MCG dose; which put me into Hyperthyroidism according to TSH numbers; I fell asleep in public twice.  This has NEVER happened to me before.  I could not get up in the mornings; was tired all the time and had brain fog.  I think I could've slept 24/7.  Very frustrating.  Also had weight gain.,Began at 75 MCG and they lowered my dose to 50 MCG and the fatigue/sleepy/brain fog symptoms got better (I did not fall asleep in public again) but I was still more tired and foggy than I was before I began taking the medication.  I took the medication in textbook form--first thing in the morning and did not eat for 4 hours.  Finally; the doctor gave me permission to stop taking because I was afraid the physical symptoms were going to negatively impact my job.  Had my blood checked last week after one month off the medication and numbers showed I was back in hypothyroidism.  Doctor is mystified at my symptoms; which for the most part seem to be the opposite of what they should have been on the medication.  He prescribed me Armour today and I am scheduled to go back in 6 weeks to have my blood checked.  I am a healthy; 36 year old female.  I exercise regularly and attempt a healthy diet.  We'll see if this works better for me.

My weight has remaind the same.  The depression has not gotten noticeably better; and fatigue continues to be a problem.,I have not noticed any side effects thus far.  I've been on the Synthroid for only 4 weeks; so it may not yet be at its full effectiveness.  I've also just found out I should take it on an empty stomach and then wait an 30 min. to and hour prior to eating for it to be 100% effective.,I am taking the Synthroid to increase metabolism; stop weight gain; help with depression; and to reduce fatigue.  I have been complaining of chronic fatigue for 10 years; and the depression has been an issue for about the same length of time.  The weight gain has occurred within the last 3 years and was significant (for me) within the last two years.  My primary physician told me that my levels were within range; however; the NP I work for (a mental health nurse practitioner)reviewed the levels for depression and found the my levels were just below the norm; enough to make a difference.
patient,49,female,slow thyroid  & irregular period,none,none,Tirosint (Levothyroxine) ,Anticoagulants Antithyroid-Agents Coagulants Hormones,9,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,100 mcg  (dosage frequency: daily)  for the period of 6 months,more energy and alertness; less fatigue & regular normal period duration. Periods had been irregular; and often very heavy with severe cramps and clotting. Mental attitude improved. I became less tired during the day and required fewer hours of sleep to feel fully rested.

It got to the point I was taking naps for the first time since I was a small child; and still didn't feel refreshed.  I also felt cold frequently and had put on a good 20 pounds in a year.  When I went for my annual physical; my blood work came back with high cholesterol for the first time.  I thought it was advancing middle age.  Fortunately; my MD put it all together and ordered a thyroid test.  I was very low.  Within two weeks; I felt energized and my mood improved.  I have shed some (not all; darn it) of the weight and my cholesterol score is lower.  ,I had none except for a few hot flashes (well past menopause) that went away in the first few weeks.  I have never been a pill-taker for fear of side effects; but this was a good experience.  Fortunately; the initial dose was effective and did not need adjustment.,As I said; my doctor spotted the symptoms and ordered a thyroid test.  When it came back very low; she prescribed 75 mg a day of levothyroxine; and I felt a little better almost immediately.  Within 2 weeks; I felt younger; more energy; better mood and my weight gain stopped.  I have enough energy to exercize and with only a slight shift in my fairly healthy diet to less fat and more fruits and vegetables; the weight has slowly come off.  I have my thyroid checked every 6 months with good results so far.  Between the medication and some dietary changes; my cholesterol is down from 230 to 206.  I still have about 6 pounds to get back to my starting weight.  Unless there's a permanent cure out there; I won't mind taking this little lifesaver forever.

My Endo said that the swelling and pain wasnt from the Tirosint and that I should see my Primary doctor...REALLY??  I was shocked due to my "hypo" symptoms.

I did not feel highs or lows and hardly knew I was taking it except it helped my anxiety.,occasional dry mouth,I could not take any anti-depressant medications. I tried them all but had terrible side effects. My doctor is extremely good with medication therapy for depression and anxiety and decided I have a serotonin sensitivity and so put me on this drug which works on a different endorphin pathway called gabba. I have had terrific success on it and although it too has addictive properties like other Diazapenes; I have not had to increase my dose at all therefore he doesn't think true physiological dependence is developing.

Good at generally calming me down and 'leveling me out' to make functioning easier.  Helps a little to relax muscle tension.  Calming effect makes an excellent sleep aid.,Fatigue can sometimes be excessive.  High dependency.,Used for general anxiety and as an adjunct for depression and chronic pain.  Very good at alleviating any anxiety and jittery feelings.  'Levels out' my mood but doesn't cause euphoria; I have no desire to take more than I need.  However I am very dependent on it; if I stop taking it for a couple of days I have bad nervousness and jitteryness; tachycardia; sweating; and other anxiety symptoms.  If I wanted to discontinue I would have to do _very_ slowly; but this is the nature of long-term benzodiazepine treatment.

You become dependent on them and you need more and more to reduce your anxiety. It is very difficult to get off this drug. It make you gain wait and you have to get off of it eventually. You have to get off them slowly,i took the drug for a long time and wit was really amazing and i like it and it was awewesome and it was afucn and it was cool and it was sweet but it was verry addicting and it sohouldnt be used for a long period of time because it losses effectiness over time

The withdrawal is horrid; and there are tons of people suffering because of this.,I had post-partum anxiety/depression; and was misdiagnosed with Bipolar with a post-partum onset. The Klonopin was prescribed for anxiety; a long term anxiety reducer. I saw little to no benefit. I was later rediagnosed by another doctor who said I absolutely did not have Bipolar; and slowly took me off my meds (5 years ago); which I'd been taking for six years. All drugs were easy to get off slowly; with the exception of Klonopin; which was hideous. The only way to get this drug out of my system was to do a Klonopin/Librium switch...and the Librium was very easy to get off of; thank goodness!
patient,38,female,Insommnia,None,Low dose doxepin,Klonopin (Clonazepam) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents,1,Moderately Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,1mg  taken most nights for the period of 1 year,Initially did help with sleep. Over time tolerance developed and depression and grogginess ensued.,On attempting to withdraw very severe side effects of withdrawal that lasted over one year: personality changes; anxiety; severe sleeplessness. A disaster!,Withdrawal had to be done very slowly over several months. I would NEVER use benzodiazepines ever again. They are for single use only. Have since learned that even after a few days use there can be rebound effects. These drugs are dangerous. Period.

patient,55,female,TIA type Seizures; Stress,high cholesterol,Aggrenox/Lovastatin 10mg ,Klonopin (Clonazepam) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Benzodiazepines Benzodiazepines Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents,1,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,.05  (dosage frequency: 3x daily)  for the period of 3 years,None.  I went from 140lbs down to 98lbs.  I did have reoccuring episodes (TIA like - diagnosed as TIA for lack of conclusive evidence or further investigation)  I now believe it was mostly stress and menopause related issues.  ,I do not know that all side effects were attributable to the Clonozapam alone or a combination of one or all drugs.  I did take just the Clonozapm and Lovastatin the first year.   Regardless; everytime I looked up a symptom on the web; it always pointed to MS.  My Neurologist did say we should investigate it; but we never did.  Anyway; I could not sleep for days on end; I had excessive hand tremors; voice tremors; unsteady gait; tintinnitus; eyesight problems; urinary problems; memory problems and a bunch more I can't even recall at the moment.  I weaned myself off the medicine in 3 months time and am very much improved but only after months and possibly years of being removed from all the problems.  I'd like to mention that at one point in time I took the cholesterol drug that Dr. Jarvis promotes...I can't remember the name and had to quit within the first week as it gave me pains in the front of my thighs that could take your breath away.  I know for a fact that that symptom was in fact attributable to that drug.  A good effect that came from that drug though was the almost immediate shrinkage of my breast cysts...I had many on both sides.  Upon starting on that drug; I could actually feel them draining; dissapating or whatever you might call it.  They have not returned; so I am very thankful for that aspect of the drug.  Because of the leg pain though; I found it intolerable.,I am not sure what you mean as I already told you that I was being treated for TIA like seizures with the Clonozapam and Aggrenox as a blood thinner for the same.  I also took Lovastatin for High Cholesterol.  In the course of all these medications I ended up getting a divorce.  The drugs did not lower my cholesterol... they made me more nervous and made me question what on earth was wrong with me?  I now weigh more than I ever have; and I started to gain wieght almost immediately after getting off of the drugs.  I could use to lose 20lbs; but I am not worried about it as I am so much healthier than I was during the time I was on all of the drugs.  I hope this has helped you in some way.  I am sorry that I can't be more specific; but I am in a hurry to put all of that behind me and build a healthier - drug free future.  I am very much a proponent of natural medicines these days!

If I felt panicky and wanted to relax I could. I don't have alot of benefits to say because I think the grouchiness outweighs the good side effects to me! ,Very grouchy! To the point I wanted to argue with people. Just felt on edge; relaxed if I laid around but get up and do something just mean and grouchy! I seem to want to eat more too when I first started it. Not when taken but craved sweets. ,1/2 a pill twice daily for 20 days and 1/2 a pill when anxious. This treatment was to make sure I didn't get panicky and could relax. I did feel relaxed but grouchy!

Heart palpitations were lessened in frequency and running thoughts were ceased. I was able to fall asleep more quickly because I wasn't as consumed by worries. In fact; I found myself able to do things that before I wasn't able of doing; like having conversations with irritating family members.,I felt very depressed on the days after I'd taken the medicine. The anxiety was always replaced with depression.,I was given a RX and I took one pill once a day for three months. I then stopped treatment because I realized I would rather have a good amount of anxiety than be depressed walking around. I have anxiety; but I'm a basically happy person.

It really was miraculous; as they were becoming more and more frequent and severe.  On the combination of klonopin and prozac; I have not experienced a panic attack in 10 years. I simply feel "normal"; and am able to go through my days without any feelings of extreme nausea or dizziness; which is how my panic attacks manifested themselves.  No longer did I have to leave work early; avoid restaurants and supermarkets; or worry about getting suddenly "sick"; for no reason.,I experienced no side effects.  I was not tired nor did I feel medicated.  ,I started both klonopin and prozac together.  At first; I took klonopin 4 times a day.  Then gradually I was able to cut back to twice a day; first thing in the morning and again at dinnertime.  I did this very gradually; cutting out first the noontime dosage; and then the bedtime one.  I have never had talk-therapy at all.  I continue to take klonopin; or the generic clonazapam to this day with no adverse reactions at all.

After a few days on welbutrin I experienced the worst panic attack ever. I thought the end was near. I had had them in the past; but nothing like this. It probably lasted only about 5 minutes but seemed an eternity. The rest of that particular day I was completely exhausted. That was a Sunday and the following day my family doctor stopped all my meds and switched me over to clonazepam and zoloft. It's been a year now and I haven't felt this well in a long time. Minimal side effects.,Maybe a little bit of drowsiness from time to time; but other than that nothing else.,Just visit the doctor from time to time and take klonopin twice a day and my 200 mgs of zoloft once a day.

I could eat one low calorie meal in a day and not lose one pound.,I would see a psychiatrist once a month.  The doctor would ask me how I was feeling and would change the dosage if neccesary.
patient,50,female,seizures,thirsty,none,Dilantin (Phenytoin) ,Anticonvulsants,8,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,100 mg  taken 3 xs a day for the period of 5 years,to prevent seizures after being exposed to lead in our old  house in Philadelphia I started having seizues after testing there was no evidence of elipesy or history of elipesy in our family but still was diagnosed with a seizure disorder and after testing it was discovered that my metabolism was so high that it was tough to keep the proper amount of levels without constant blood level checks,gum swelling,3 x a day

It felt like concentrated acid was being injected into my vains with a painful burning sensation that lasted several minutes after each injection. After 3 weeks I was changed to oral dilantin (100mg 3 times daily). So no more painful injections. ,As mentioned above I was prescibed Dilantin to avoid seizures following brain surgery. I was given dilantin injections for a period of 3 weeks while in hospital and then it changed to taking oral dilantin (100mg 3 times daily)for a year. During the year I had one seizure after 6 months which happened on the night that I felt well enough to have some drinks with my friends for the first time since the operation. I didn't drink again for the following 6 months while on dilantin and did not have any more seizures. I stopped dilantin after 12 months and have had no seizures since

patient,37,female,seizure disorder,AVM; depression,Lexapro,Keppra (Levetiracetam) ,Anticonvulsants,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,1000mg  taken twice daily for the period of 6 months,Benefits were milder and less frequent seizures.,Tiredness,Started taking after brain injury due to AVM and radiation treatment.  First seizure was major; requiring hospitalization.  After taking Keppra; a susequent seizure was very mild.

Reduced to 1000 mg per day and sought alternative methods..research by Harvard showed magnesium deficit in those with seizure disorders..began magnesium injections and increased essential fatty acids..through proper nutrition; supplementation and accupuncture; no more seizure medication and seizure free...do want to note that seizures began during the spraying of the neurotoxin anvil for the West Nile virus.
patient,38,female,anti seizure,none,none,Keppra (Levetiracetam) ,Anticonvulsants,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,750mg  taken everyday for the rest of my life for the period of 3 years,no seizure activity since i started taking this drug,early on i was having problems sleeping; s i got used to the medication; that has gone away.,Taking 750 mg split into 2 doses; taking morning and evening; i have small seizures as a result of a brain tumor removal received 4 years ago.

The Flovent has been particularly helpful in preventing flareups of my symptoms which has greatly reduced the need for my Albuterol.  The benefits of taking the Keppra is that I have only had one seizure episode since I began treatment in 2006.  The episode lasted only seconds.,I have no side effects from taking my asthma medications.  I experienced a lack of enery or just feeling tired when I first started taking the Keppra in the morning.  I do not have that system any longer.,I take my asthma medications daily and will continue to do so for the rest of my life.  The same is true for my seizure medication.
care giver,20,female,for epilepsy,none,klonopin (to aid effectiveness of Keppra),Keppra (Levetiracetam) ,Anticonvulsants,5,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1500 mgs. a day  taken twice a day for the period of still on it,We aren't sure.  We wonder if it is really controlling the seizures at all.  We are hoping our daughter can get testing to determine if her seizures are catamenial in nature.  She was on carbatrol with complete control; but was switched to Keppra due to her upcoming marriage (much lower risk of birth defects and ability to use birth control pills while on it).  She was completely weaned off of Carbatrol at one point and went almost 8 weeks with no seizure activity.  She also went 5-1/2 months with no seizure activity with Keppra before having a tonic clonic seizure.  Due to her history of seizures (started at the age of 14 a couple of months after she started her period); and the ability to go for long periods of time without problems; we wonder if she is having extreme spikes in estrogen when she ovulates from time to time. We hope that our neurologist will work with an endocrinologist and gynocologist to see if there is some validity to our theory.  The goal is to get her back under complete control.,The main side effect we noticed with Keppra was weight loss.  She dropped 20 lbs. in less than a month.  She had a very suppressed appetite for the first 6 or 7 months.  She has since gained back maybe 5 lbs. but continues to have a suppressed appetite just not as much as at first. ,She takes 3 pills in the morning upon waking and 2 pills at night before going to bed.  She was taking 1 Klonopin pill but is now taking Lamictal and is gradually increasing the dosage.  Her neurologist is weaning her off of Keppra and gradually moving her to Lamictal.
patient,46,female,Post Traumatic Stress Syndrom,fibromyaglgia,Wellbutrim; Nortriptiline; tryptophan; synthroid,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,75 mg afternoon  100 mg bed  taken twice daily for the period of have been for 2 years,Decreased appetite/impulse or emotional eating; stress reduction; anti depressant,vision affects - blurry vision,I believe that the topamax has helped me to lose 90 pounds of excess weight - I still need to lose at least another 50 pounds.    It helped stabalize my moods and I didn't feel so sad and depressed after going through an abusive marriage/separation then divorce.  My psychiatrist prescribed Topamax during that time.   Then I was able to discontinue treatment for about 2 years.   I then had an accident; where I was then diagnosed with PTSD and fibromyalgia as a result of the accident and have since been on Topamax for two years steady since the accident.   I have lost the weight in the last 16 months.
patient,41,female,migraine prevention,asthma/allergies; depression; hypo-thyroidism,wellbutrin se; synthroid ; maxifed; advair; zysal; imitrex; erinn,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,100 mg.   taken twice daily for the period of 2 years ,Went from approx. 17 migraine days a month to approx. 4 migraine days a month while taking topamax and erinn.  (Before adding erinn; was down to approx. 8 migraine days a month.)  Topamax seemed to greatly lessen the hypersensitivity of my brain to overreact to triggers such as changes in altitude; barometric pressures; humidity levels; environmental triggers such as smoke; strong smells; loud noises; and food triggers such as dark chocolate.  Before topamax all of these things would cause migraines to start very easily.  After settling in on topamax these things didn't bother me like they used to.  ,When first starting the drug; diet soda tasted metallic and downright horrible.  There was definitely an adjustment period of getting used to the drug and increasing the dosage in small increments was important.  I could feel changes in my brain that are hard to describe.  Almost like the top was a little bit "lifted".  It was worth getting through this period for the results; though.  They definitely went away as my body got accustomed to the drug.  Once that happened; the migraines lessened and one pleasant side effect was that I didn't snack as often.  No "mindless munching."  I lost some weight without trying.  I felt that it was difficult to retrieve thoughts or find the right word at times.  I found it would take a few seconds longer to put my thoughts into words.  Felt a little "spacey."  As I mentioned before; I got through it after getting used to the drug.  It took several weeks but after having 17 migraine days a month and going down to 8 it was worth it.  ,Started at 25mg 2x a day for several days and started titrating up by adding 25mg to the evening dose every 3-4 days; depending on how I felt.  Got up to 100 mg. a day for the first year.  After moving and talking to my new doctor; she suggested increasing the dose to see if I could have less migraines than the 10-12 I was having so I titrated up to 200mg a day and my migraines went down to 8 a month.  
patient,45,female,bipolar II,alcoholism,celexa,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,150mg  taken once a day for the period of 2 years,treated hypomanic systems; reduced impulsivity; reduced cravings for alcohol; reduced irratibility; loss of weight (15 lbs); more stable moods; ,cognitive impairments; difficulty remembering names; memory problems; loss of weight,was identified with Bipolar II two years ago presenting with mixed states.  Hospitalized one week for high anxiety and depression.  Relapsed into alcoholism which exacerbated symptoms. Doctor diagnosed BPII and prescribed Topomax to help diminish alcohol cravings in addition to BP symptoms. Initially became depressed and lethargic. These feelings subsided after three weeks.  Weight loss was dramatic and quick. Cravings dimished; felt more balanced; less irritable and impulsive.
patient,35,female,weight loss,none,none,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,9,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,50mg/day   taken 1/day for the period of 6 months,Topamax decrease my appetite significantly.  I lost an average of 15 pounds per month while taking the 50 mg/day. I had no side effects during the course of the treatment; the only real drawback was the need to taper off the drug slowly rather than just being able to stop taking it.,I experienced no side effects.,I neared a better weight; the doctor began tapering off and the weight loss significantly slowed and in fact stopped before I was able to stop taking the medication.  
patient,43,female,Migraine prevention,Allergies,Benadryl; Aleve. birth control pills,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,10,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,Five  25 mg tablets Twice a Day  taken daily for the period of 3 Years,Topamax helped decrease the frequency and intensity of my migraines.,Treatment side effects include paresthesia of my hands and mild drowsiness. ,Topamax was taken in order to prevent migraines. I also monitored my diet to avoid migraine triggers such as caffeine; aged cheeses; preserved meats; bananas; avocados; beans; dairy products; beer; wine; etc. In addition; I took birth control pills to control hormonal fluctuations. This helped prevent menstrual migraines. 
patient,44,female,migraines,None,Synthroid; Ortho cyclen,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,100mg  taken once a day for the period of 2 years,Significantly reduced migraines frequency and severity,mild tingling sensation in fingers and toes for several weeks after starting; occaissional problems remembering names; lethargy after taking but this was addressed by adjusting time of dosage to bedtime.,I sought treatment for frequent severe migrains. I started getting migraines at age 30 and in recent months had been having 2-3 migrains a week. I was taking Imitrex at the initial sign of a migrain (eye aura) but this was had limited effectiveness. My doctor recommended trying Topamax. In the first 2 months I had 2 migrains and have only had 4 in the last 18 months. I take 100mg at bed because it makes very relaxed and sleep very deeply. I very occasionally find myself forgetting nouns and proper names but that has been the only cognitive effect. I still have been able to be effective and focused at my job. 
patient,39,female,Migraine,bi-polar disorder,klonopin; prozac,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,200 MG  taken 2x per day for the period of 4 years,Greatly reduced severe migraines that were occurring almost daily.  This drug was added as a preventative medication when migraines became so dibilitating that I could not function in everyday life; i.e.; go to work; take care of self and family; etc.  Migraines were reduced after approximately 6-8 weeks on the medication to about 1 per month and then continually reduced to 1 every 3 to 6 months as I stayed on the medication.  I also use the medication to manage my mood disorder (bi-polar disorder) and was able to not have to take a mood stabalizer; because this drug also manages to keep me from getting "manic"; so it is an extra "bonus" on top of the migraine management!!,The only side effect I noticed was some weight loss in the beginning.  My doctor was very careful to start me out on 50 MG and move me up VERY slowly to the 200 MG 2x per day; which I understand is a very high dosage and took all of 4 years to get to that dosage.  I was monitored every 30 days to ensure that I was not losing too much weight; having any type of eye problems; or numbness in my hands or feet--the eye problems; and numbness I never experienced; but was always told that if I did experience even a hint of these things; that I would have to stop the medication immediately--so my doctor does constantly ask me about those things.  I have also read that Topamax has been used to treat alcoholics; and have noticed that since taking it; I have no desire to drink alcohol at all--but I am not an alcoholic--just a unique observation.  It really just seems like a great drug!!,I am still taking it to manage both  my migraines and my mood disorder--200 MG 2x per day.  I take 2 in the AM and 2 in the PM.  It is prescribed by my Neurologist and managed by him mostly; and my psychatrist also works with him; because if I ever go off of the drug; I would be required to go onto a mood stabalizer due to the bi-polar disorder.  I would be very unhappy to have to go back onto something like Depakote; because that made me very slow and sluggish and Topamax does not have that side effect.
patient,33,female,migranes,none,none,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,25mg  taken 1 daily for the period of 2 years,there were no benefits. i had severe side effects. . the medication helped the headaches for a short amount of time but the side effects outweighed the benefits. i call it the stupid medicine because i literally turned stupid after using it.,forgetfulness; shakes; loss of balance; loss of muscle mass,i was to take one pill daily for the maintence of migraine headaches. i never could progress to the higher does to see if it helped b/c the side effects on the low dose was terrible
patient,47,female,migraine,none,hormone replacement therapy (natural cream),Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,25mg  taken 2 x daily for the period of 1 year and current,has definately had a positive influence on the migraines. It seems to have some sort of effect on eating though. I did loose a bit more weight which I did not need to loose; but now have been able to be back at my normal weight.,Some forgetfulness;; tiredness at onset. Nothing unbearable.,25mg morning and night. 9 months; then went to 15mg capsules morning and night for a few months. Now down to 15mg at night time only.
patient,50,female,severe headaches,anxiety and depression,propranalol and citalopram,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,1,Considerably Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,25mg  taken 4 times per day for the period of 1 month,they helped to reduce headaches that I had been sufferein over a period of over 2 years,I noticed; after only a couple of weeks that my anxiety and depression had to an almost unbearable level; I looked at the tablets side effects and realised that they must be the contributing factor as my condition had remained stable for a few years; before i started taking them.  the side effects still remain; months after stopping the medication.,I took 1 x 25mg per day which built up to 4 x 25mg per day over 4 weeks
patient,42,female,sedative/hypnotic - to induce sleep,morbid obesity; depression; hydrocephalis caused by sub-arachnoid cyst ,elavil 225mg hr;  effexor 150mg xr; vit D 1000u,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,5,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,titrated up to 250mg  taken h.s. for the period of ongoing-now taking 150mg h.s.,topamax was originally prescribed to eventually replace in part or totally the Elavil I was taking as sleep med.  Elavil and Effexor were thought to initiate cravings for carbohydrates that would lead to overeating and overweight.  I was taking 300mg Elavil each night.  The goal was to completely switch from Elavil to Topamax.  Topamax also had the added benefit of preventing migraines which I am prone to because of my hydrocephalis caused by a sub arachnoid cyst. I have a VP shunt,I had to stop increasing the dose of Topamax when I reached 225mg because I experienced peripheral neuropathy in my fingertips and also blurred vision.  I am now taking 150 mg topamax and 225mg elavil hs.  ,was told to increase topamax in 25mg doses every week.  When excessive sedation was experienced; I was to cut back 50mg of Elavil.  I proceeded like this until i reached a topamax dose of 250mg and elavil 150mg; but I wasn't sleeping at night and my vision was blurred and my fingers tingled.  The doses were fine tuned to a comfort level of 150mg topamax and 225 elavil to this date.  Switching the effexor to cymbalta is the next phase; all in the name of decreasing the carbohydrate cravings....wish me luck!
patient,50,female,migraines,nausea,n/a,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,3,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,50mg.   taken 2x day for the period of 1 1/2 year,after the tritation period; where the drug dosage was increased each week; the headaches became less severe and less frequent. from having 2-3 migraines a week to eventually having none and was able to discontinue the medication.,most irritating was the stupor the drug caused..aka "stupermax",never lost weight on this drug as some do-- since discontinued I have lost 7 lbs. 
patient,32,female,OCD,Anxiety,None,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,200 mg  taken once a day for the period of 3 years,Although Topamax is an anti-epileptic; which is more commonly perscribed for the treatment of migrains...it had a substancial benefit to my OCD symptoms.  It significantlly reduced my desire (or calling) to repeat (recheck; recount; retouch) items; which was a huge issue for me.  In the past; it would take me hours to complete the most mundane tasks; but with the Topamax; I can more easily "let go" of certain rituals and walk away feeling "complete" without having to repeat them countless times...,I experienced some mild loss of appetite early on; which graduly disappaited.  ,also must note that in the way past I was on Prozax; Paxil; Celexa; Luvox; Valium; Xanax; Clozapam...all with little or no success.
patient,39,female,Migraines,High Blood Pressure,NORTYPTILINE; ATENOLOL,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,25mg; 50mg  taken daily for the period of 21/2 years ,Topamax greatly reduced severe migraines that were occurring almost daily and it  seemed to greatly lessen the hypersensitivity of my brain to overreact to triggers that caused my migraines(stress; changes in barometric pressure;certain food;smells;noise; and light);stabled moods;reduced irritability; increased weight loss(40lb).,Tingling in arms and legs; loss of appetite; tiredness; metallic taste; a bit of coordination problem (couple of incidents while backing up the car from garage).,I started with a low dose(25mg) first week every other day; second week we increased it to once every day; then the following week increase the dose in the evening; following week increased the dose in the morning also. After approximately 4 weeks we maintained the dose(50mg taken 2X daily)for almost a year at which time I started to decrease the dose very slowly and stop taking it do to lack of migraines.6-8 months down the lane the migraines start coming back not as strong but just in case I got back on medication starting very low dose and very slow again.Stop taking medications after 10 months and been migraine free ever since(just a handful in the last 4 years).
patient,70,female,appetite control,type II diabetes,metaformin; amaryl; lisinopril; simivastin,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,75 mg  taken daily for the period of 2 years 7 months,Lost 52 pounds with the meds and a diet program.  Was able to reduce the amount of dose on the diabetic meds.    ,For a while was on higher dose of topomax at 100 mg but seem to experience some memory issues but did not have any further issue with this once the dose was reduced.,This was an off label use of topomax which was under the supervision of my doctor who saw me regularly for diabetes.  It was important to lose weight to improve the diabetic condition.  It was supportive in helping me maintain the discipline of the diet program that the doctor also recommended so that with the combined approach I succeeded in losing 52 pounds in a slow; healthy manner.  
patient,23,female,Depression/Binge Eating,Anxiety,Prozac; minocycline,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,200 mg  taken once daily for the period of 2006-present (3 years),With the Topamax alone; and not myself consciously changing any of my dietary habits or exercising; I lost about 10% of my body weight in the first two months of treatment. It was like a tiny switch in my brain was flipped and I just didn't crave gargantuan massive quantities of horrible-for-you food. Not that food didn't taste good; or I wasn't hungry; I just filled up really quickly; and nothing seemed any more appealing than anything else. So when you're not just going off whatever looks yummy at that exact second and you actually stop and think about what you're about to eat; you tend to choose something a tad bit healthier and less caloric. Combine that with the fact that it would take about half the amount to fill me up; and there you have your weight loss. ,Dry mouth (I was also taking Prozac at the time which definitely contributed); mild transient tingling in the hands and feet (pins and needles); I've read a lot of posts in forums online from people suffering memory problems with Topamax (i.e. dopamax); they forget words easily; have trouble spelling; feel foggy; etc... I guess I'm one of the few fortunate people whom Topamax doesn't effect that way. Either that; or the dose I'm at (200 mg) is well below my tolerance threshold. Many of the people in these forums were being treated for epilepsy and debilitating migraines and taking doses up to 1200mg.,I had done some research on Topamax online before it was even an approved treatment for migraines; and it was only FDA approved for epilepsy. While on the web I found that a surprising amount of doctors were prescribing it for off-label purposes; such as an add-on to an SSRI that wasn't working well enough in depressed patients; a mood stabilizer in patients with bipolar disorder; and (gasp!) a weight loss drug in obese patients and in those with binge eating disorder. Several convincing clinical studies have been done in all of the above categories as well. Topamax will have clearance from the FDA to be marketed for the treatment of bipolar disorder in 2010.  
patient,27,female,migraines,migraines,Imitrex,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,125mg  taken 1xday for the period of have taken it for 5 years,The topamax helped reduce the frequency of the migraines significantly.  In addition; it also helped me to loose weight at the beginning of the treatment.,imitrex makes me nauseased and makes you feel wiered after taking it.,Topamax was prescribed due to incresing occurance of migraines.  Dosage started at 50 mg and was increased to 125 until migraines were under control.  Imitrex is taken as need when migraines occur.
patient,30,female,Epilepsy,Dystonia,Dilantin; Lamictal; Zanaflex; Baclofen,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,500 mg   taken 200mg in am and 300 mg in pm for the period of started in 1996 to present,I have complex partial seizures that secondarily generalize. I was having up to 5 a week of the generalized ones in my sleep and getting injuries from them when I started topamax. The topamax stopped the generalization. I continued to have complex partials; but those are nothing in comparison to a tonic clonic seizure. I have only had one tonic clonic since being at the max dose of topamax.,topa-tingles (tingly fingers and toes) and tingles around my lips. This went away once my dose got to 400. Seeing light tracers. word loss. memory loss. hair loss. dry itchy skin. massive weight loss into the scary skinny territory. dangerously low potassium. I was able to reduce most of my side effects by taking potassium supplements and adding ensure drinks to my diet.,Topamax 200mg in the morning and 300mg in the evening. I started at a low dose and worked up to the effective dose that stopped my tonic clonic seizures (generalized seizures). It took additional medications to reduce my complex partial seizures; which I continue to have on occasion.

Lost a lot of weight.,tingling fingers temporarily; fatigue; increased hair loss; weight loss.  Blood pressure dropped very low during weight loss phase.,take one in morning and one before bed.  I have a mixture of migraine and tension headache.  The tension headaches all but disappeared.  Migraines came only 3 days before period after begining topamax.  
patient,45,female,migraines,none,none,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,25mg  taken once a day for the period of 3 years,I had suffered hemiplegic migraines and even on other medications; I still was having approximately 2-3 a month.  When I began the low dosage of topamax..the migraines virtually stopped.  I have had 1 migraine 3 years.,mild loss of appetite that occurred for approximately a 6 weeks,I took 1 25mg pill before bedtime.  
patient,57,female,migraine headaches, , ,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,200mg  taken twice a day for the period of six years/still taking it,I was suffering from migraine headaches for more than 40 years; since a teenager. Topamax has reduced twice weekly migraine headaches to approx. 3 or 4 times a year for severe migraines; although I still suffer from chronic; but infinitely much easier to bear; daily headache. I am thankful for the use of this (originally) anti-seizure drug for migraine prevention.,Mild loss of appetite. Loss of interest in alcoholic beverages.,For the past six years of treatment; via a neurologist; I have been adjusting the medication from 400mg to 600 mg per day; to the current dosage of 400mg per day; in a divided dose. One tablet am; one tablet pm. I would recommend Topamax to anyone suffering with chronic migraine as the primary drug treatment; with additional rx with triptan meds.
patient,67,female,Migraine ,None,Fosamax; Relpax,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,8,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,300 mg  taken daily for the period of 3 years,The number of migraines were reduced from 20+ a month to 12 or even less.  There have been some months when I have had only 5 or less migraines.  More importantly; the intensity of the migraines is considerably reduced.  On a pain scale of 1-10; I would have 12 or 15+ pain; that no amount of medication helped; and they would last for 3 to 5 days.  Now; when I do get a migraine; it's usually at a 2 or 3 pain level; and I rarely need to take more than 1 Relpax for relief.,One rather odd side effect; which others on the drug have commented upon; is that you forget words.  I've always been very articulate; and it can be frustrating to be in the middle of a conversation; or when I was doing training sessions; to suddenly go blank and be completely unable to remember a word I've used all my life.  Also; at one point I decided to go off the medication in the vain hope I could manage the migraines without drugs.  Even coming off the Topamax over a period of months; I gained 20 pounds.,I started on the usual dosage of 25mg in the morning and evening; then after 2 weeks increased it to 50mg twice a day.  Most people stay at this level; however; I seem to have a very high metablisim when it comes to medication; and anything I've taken for migraines always has to be increased beyond normal dosage in order to work.  Therefore; my neurologist increased the dosage to 200 mg a day; and after about a year when that no longer worked; we went to 300mg a day; which I know is high for used in migraine treatment. However; I've been on almost every migraine medication there is over the years; and there is nothing else that works.  I'm hoping for more breakthroughs in migraine research; before I end up at 400mg a day and forget half my vocabulary!
patient,19,female,Migraine,none,Elivil,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,7,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,50 Mg  taken daily for the period of 2 weeks,Ive only been on Topamax for two weeks and only have had 1 migraine which is good for me. I use to have about 3 to 4 migraines in a matter of two weeks.,I literally feel stupud; I talk in circles and I go to college so it hasen't been easy in my classes when my professors call on me. I can't remember the stupidest things or I don't like to go out with my friends anymore cause I don't like to drink alchol anymore. I also get tingles in my toes; fingers; and sometimes feel like I have a peice of hair underneith my nose when it's just a tingles in my face. I also do not have an appitite anymore which I am excited for because I used to be on elivil which made me gain 35Ibs. Also switching over from elivil to topamax is veryyyyyyyyyyy painfullll i do always have a constant headache and i'm just waiting for that side affect to go away.,The first week I took I lowered my elivil to 20Mg and started my Topamax and had that at 50Mg for the first week. The second week lower the elivil to 10mg and up the topamax to 100 mg tehn the third week stop the elivil and continue the topamax at 100mg.
patient,19,female,seizure/migraine,Syncope; heart murmur ,n/a,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,5,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,100 mg  taken 2x daily for the period of 6 months,I was prescribed this medicine by my neurologist who prescribed it to treat both seizures and migraine headaches. The medicine was very effective. In the 6 month period I was on the medicine; I only experienced 3 seizures compared to my normal 3 a week. Migraine headaches were also reduces; only apparent if triggered by something severe.,soda tasted horrible; and I had an extreme loss of appetite. No matter how badly I wanted to I was unable to eat more than a few bites of food. This caused me to lose 25 pounds; dropping me to 5'6 and under 100 pounds. Worse than the effect on my diet was how it effected my cognitive processes. I became unable to think clearly. Solving problems in my head was nearly impossible. Complete loss of focus and concentration. Extreme forgetfulness. Inability to structure sentences properly.  Very emotional; which is highly uncharacteristic of me. ,While the medicine was successful in treating both seizures and migraines; being a college student the side effects became too unbearable to continue the medication. My grades began to slip; and discontinuing the medication became necessary. 
patient,18,female,Migraines,none,Loestrin24,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,4,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,75 mg  taken every night for the period of A month and a half,My headaches were not as severe as they were before I started the medication but I still had headaches; just not as many and not as severe.,I had no appetite which caused me to lose 10 pounds in a month. Also not having an appetite made me not eat enough; so I would get more headaches because I wasn't eating enough. I also felt very depressed on this medication. During the time I was on topamax I slept a lot and didn't eat enough; I didn't feel like I was myself.,I took 25 mg for two weeks at night; then 50 mg for the next two weeks; then 75 mg for the next two then I went down to 50 mg for three days then to 25 mg for three days and I have discontinued the medication.
care giver,19,male,Tourette Syndrome,ADHD,Prozac; Focalin XR,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,10,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,50 mg  taken 1 daily for the period of 3 yrs,The treatment benefits from Topamax did not outweigh the side effects.  There was minimal reduction in vocal tics caused by Tourette Syndrome and significant reduction in appetite that led to weight loss of approx. 20 lbs.,Memory and cognitive impairment; eye pain and vision blurriness.,Topamax 50 mg was prescribed at bedtime for reduction of severe vocal tics.  Medication was prescribed by a neurologist.  The side effects far outweighed the benefits of this medication.
patient,25,female,Migraine,None in relation to my migraine condition,birthcontrol,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,100mg/day  taken 2x a day for the period of 1 month,My headaches have been considerably reduced; however; I still experience some mild headaches. The relief from my chronic and debilitating headaches has been a miracle thus far; and while I've had some pretty irritating side effects; I'm willing to put up with them so that I can live my life relatively pain free. I'm hoping the pain will pass. ,Tingling of my tongue; toes; and fingers. Some speech issues; word finding issues; major spelling issues - especially when handwriting. This is especially interesting because I'm generally an excellent speller. Unfortunately I have not experienced the weight loss side effect. ,Titrated up very; very slowly. Just recently reached my 100mgs; and have been on that for about a week. I'm hoping the weight loss will happen now that I've been on that for a week; just recently have lost my appetite. Interestingly enough; sodas don't taste all that bad to me; but I still don't really feel like having them. 
patient,25,female,migraine prevention,-,maxalt; propranolol,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,6,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,100mg  taken 50mg morning 50mg evening for the period of 3 months (so far),going from at least 5 full days of migraine a week i managed 16 whole days without one. then when i did have one it was for 6 straight days and the migraines have been back to as they were before. brief relief was seriously chuffed; now gutted; maybe dosage increase may help???,at first blurred vision and inability to find words. this settled after a couple of weeks and now the only side affect i have is that fizzy pop tastes flat,i started off taking 25mg in the evening for 2 weeks then 25mg in the morning and evening for 2weeks. this then got increased to 75mg and then 100mg
patient,41,female,Nerve Pain; Fibromyalgia,Depression; Nerve Damage; Fibromyalgia,Savella and Norco,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,50 mg  taken 3 times per day for the period of 1 month,Able to move easier; not in as much pain; more energy; sleeping better; mood is stable.,stinging and tingling in lips; feet and hands; loss of appitite; weight loss of 16 pounds in less than a month.,I am being treated for nerve damage from a neck injury and fibromyalgia that causes terrible pain. After trying just about every drug on the market; my doc gave me topamax and I started feeling better immediately. The weight loss is a super bonus because I have gained 50 pounds from all the drugs I've been taking to treat my chronic pain; so hopefully I will lose more on topamax.
patient,50,female,Migraines,None,None,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,1,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,50 mg  taken once daily for the period of 6 months,I did not experience any treatment benefits from Topamax for my severe and incapacitating migraines. I did not get relief for my migraine headaches. My migraine headaches did not stop. My migraine headaches did not decrease in duration(3 days per migraine) or intensity (severe). I had one - 3 day a week migraine for over seven years.,The Topamax treatment side effects were extreme when I was taking it.  I experienced extreme weight loss; I went from one hundred thirty pounds down to ninety eight pounds.  I experienced mental confusion and had a hard time focusing on anything including family; relationships and work.  I experienced a deep depression and had suicidal ideations that I had never before had. I also experienced loss of my word finding skills.,The treatment details for Topamax which is used to treat seizure disorders was also supposed to treat migraines are as follows.  As the patient I was to take fifty milligrams per day and was told I would lose perhaps two percent of my body weight but that after a thirty day period my migraines would decrease in intensity and decrease in duration.

Does anyone know if the side affects will goe away?,take two 100 mgs tablets in am when I was given the increase I was told to take two 100 mgs tablets in the am and 1 in the evening before bed
patient,16,female,Migraine,None ,Sumatriptan,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,3,Moderately Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,50mg-100mg  taken twice daily for the period of Six months,I first began taking Topamax when I was fifteen. I had severe migraines about five every week. When I started it did automatically begin helping me with the headaches; and then the side effects sat in very soon after. Yet; the weight loss side effect was the only positive. I lost twenty pounds. ,Within twenty minutes of taking Topamax I began to get tingles in my feet and bad in my hands. The next two weeks when they had moved my doze from 50mg to 100mg I felt like a dud in class. I couldn't remember anything that I would have been able to grasp so much more quickly before. I would stumble on my words and get so confused. On top of all this; I was constantly in a bad mood and depressed. I finally said enough was enough the day I got over heated at the lake; I got over heated because Topamax doesn't let you sweat. Overall; the side effects over ruled the relief. ,Above.
patient,32,female,Epilepsy,Osteoporosis; Dystonia,Lamictal; Dilantin; Zanaflex; Forteo,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,200mg  taken twice a day for the period of 14 yrs,I started Topamax right after approval due to ongoing generalized (Grand mal) seizures that were resistant to other drugs. My epileptologist was hoping this would be the one. We added it on to what I was currently taking at the time (tegratol and dilantin) and crossed our fingers. Guess what? After reaching 400mg a day- I went from having 3-4 generalized seizures A WEEK; to 3 TOTAL in many many years! Unfortunately; I continued having partial complex seizures until we found the Dilantin/Lamictal/Topamax combo (in the last 3 years) and I still have 1 or 2 of those a month.  I really owe my life to topamax. AWESOME drug. Awesome awesome awesome. ,still have dilantin side effects which are easy to distinguish as I've been on that since 1985; but the topamax ones are gone barring once and awhile I have a bit of 'loss of words' while speaking. I love this drug. ,I take one 200mg tab in the morning and one 200mg tab in the evening. I take the brand name topamax as the generic one caused my blood levels to dive a bit and I had a breakthrough seizure. Too bad as the generic is much cheaper. 
patient,21,female,Borderline Personality Disorder,Bipolar II,Cipralex 20mg; Clonidine,Topamax (Topiramate) ,Anticonvulsants Anticonvulsants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,4,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,50mg  taken 1x daily for the period of Still taking,Some weight loss/craving control; lessened desire to drink,Tons of tingling in the hands/feet; intense hypersomnia (sleeping 16+ hours a day); increased aggressiveness; loss of appetite; lack of energy,Topiramate was given as a mood stabilizer for bipolar and BPD; ended up sleeping a great deal of the time; which I suppose stabilizes your moods if you're never awake to have them.
patient,21,female,ADHD,IDDM,insulin,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,10mg  taken 1/day for the period of 8 days,none,visual disturbances; weight gain; insomnia; anxiety; hyperglycemia; headaches; mild hallucinations; water retention; difficulty concentrating; memory lapses; erratic behaviour. these side effects lasted for several weeks after I stopped taking the medication; and my vision did not return to normal for almost a month.  my doctor said it was an anti-cholinergic reaction. ,i started at a very low dose; to be worked up gradually. treatment ended before this could happen.
care giver,51,female,ADHD,none,none,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,5,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,20 -25 mg  taken 1 x day for the period of 2 tears,Slowed down hyperactivity in a nine year old boy; increased attending a little bit although not strongly.  It does not interfere with sleep which many of the stimpulant meds do.  There were no mood swings until the dosage was increased.  ,When the dose was raised; the patient suffered suicidal ideation!  This was bad.  At lower dose it seemed to be ok.  Dosage takes 2-3 weeks to take affect.  Side effects also will not be observed until dose builds up in the system.  You may see lesser instances of self denegration first.  Watch for that.  ,Take pill once a day
patient,26,female,ADHD,None,ALLEGRA,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,60 mg  taken once daily for the period of 4 YRS,Stratterra enabled me to concentrate and focus on tasks at hand.  It makes a world of difference in my daily life.  After four years of using Stratterra; I would never switch to a different ADHD medication., Stratterra surpresses my appetite and makes me feel quite dependent on the drug to function. If I take with my multivitamin; I often feel nauseous. ,   I take 1 60 mg of Stratterra in the morning daily.
patient,55,female,ADD,none,primpro,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,40mg 1-2x/day  taken 1/day for the period of 2 years,Treatment benefits include improved attention to task; improvement in work quality and quantity. Impulsivity was greatly reduced; resulting in a calmer more productive day. Social relationships with co-workers and others were markedly improved. Social relationships with extended family members were also improved. As a result there was a marked improvement in self esteem and confidence levels both at work and at home.,There wer few side effects.  I experienced intermittent episodes of dry mouth that interferes when during public speaking; speaking at meetings and in social situations.  This can be resolved with small candies; however; that resulted in tooth decay.  I am currently trying out a gel and mouthwash given to me by my dentist; however; I am not happy about putting these chemicals in my mouth.,I am not sure what you want in this section.  I received counseling.  Medication was suggested.  Other more typical; stimulant  medications were tried but produced anxiety.  This is a newer non-stimulant medication; and that is a plus. I have continued counseling and periodic check-ups with the prescribing physician.  I am pleased with the results and plan on continuing with this treatment.
patient,40,female,ADULT ADD,high blood pressure,lysinopryl,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,3,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects, 10mg; 20mg;  taken daily for the period of 1 yr,I was much more awake in the mornings instead of groggy and foggy -brained. I was able to focus a LITTLE bit better,Blurry vision; increased bladder leaks;moodiness; a little weight gain which may not be from Strattera,Unfortunately I had a doctor who was uneducated about ADD and was very uncomfortable prescribing any medications for it. She put me on 10mg first.After 3-4 weeks I went back and asked for her to increase it. She prescribed 20mg;(which I found they don't make 20mg doses) Instead of changing it to a proper mg; she decided to have me take 2 10mg pills every morning which also doubled the cost and that amount was not enough to have much benefit. After about a year ; I was finally prescribed a therapeutic dosage of 40mg. I had too many problems with the pharmacy ordering the right amount ( they had me take 4 10mg pills a day because they didn't order the right ones! I have no health insurance so was getting it on some program that made it cost me $6 but when they would screw up the order ; I would either run out or have to get the full amount which was $130.00 at the 10mgs; so X 2 for 20mg; x 4 for 40mgs!! Just because of the way the pharmacy was doing it.Scamming the federal programs or  something...so I finally just quit taking it. I definately had noticed that it made pee without barely any warning; and my eyesight got alot worse; and my fiance said it made me "mean". All that has stopped now that I am not on it. But my ADD is back full force!

I can't describe it except to say I felt out of sorts.  I had trouble with perspiring and being cold and overly warm.  I would feel cold inside and chilled sometimes and then I'd feel very warm and start to perspire.  ,When I first started taking it; I felt odd.  I can't describe it except to say I felt out of sorts.  I had trouble with perspiring and being cold and overly warm.  I would feel cold inside and chilled sometimes and then I'd feel very warm and start to perspire.  ,I'm taking this because I have trouble with details.  Things like where I parked my car.  I go into the kitchen to get a glass of water and open the refrigerator.  I come out of a business and walk around aimlessly because I have no clue where my car is.  Things are much better now; I rarely have occurrences like this any more.
patient,43,female,adult ADD,hypercoagulable state; depression; ,warfarin; zoloft,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,100 mg per day  taken once before bed for the period of 2 years,calming effect; helped with sleep; helped with concentration; reduced appetite; improved depressive symptoms,nausea at first; agitation at first; sleeplessness initially. it seemed to take away my sense of urgency for things a bit; which was good for alleviating anxiety but might have caused difficulties with timeliness at work and time management overall. ,Long history of ADD symptoms eventually diagnosed at age 37. had to stop taking medicine because i left job and health insurance lapsed. this medicine was far more effective for me than adderal; which caused me to be very emotionally labile and sensitive; and caused dramatic blood sugar drops. i really wish i could go back on strattera; it really felt right for me.
patient,22,female,ADHD (Predominantly Inattentive),Asthma; Pollen Allergies; ,None,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,25 mg  taken daily for the period of Still taking,The "head made of air" feeling I tend to have goes away:I become more attentive; much more aware of my surroundings; feel much more grounded in the "here/now"; and much better able to focus. My mind stops trying to jump from one subject to another every second; memory retention/recall improves DRAMATICALLY. I also find it FAR easier to fall asleep at night; seem to sleep better; and seem to be far more emotionally stable. I also do not "crash" from it later in the day like my former (stimulant) meds. Also does not appear to be physically addictive.,Severe grogginess; often accompanied by lightheadedness; upset stomach/nausea - ALL aggravated by sleep loss or lack of food; become slightly less severe after I'd been on it again for a couple of weeks. Severe grogginess was slightly alleviated by caffeine (espresso) or some rest (nap) or both. Best solution appears to be to take the meds with or after food; and to attempt to get a decent amount of sleep. Also notice a certain level of dependence (NOT actual addiction though) - mostly due to return of symptoms in medication's absence. I may also have dry mouth; but I'm not sure if that's the meds or if I'm not drinking enough water. ,Best way I've discovered to eliminate the side effects is to eat a protein-rich breakfast (usually egg/ham/cheese sandwich for me); then WAIT for at least a few minutes -anywhere from 15 to 60 or more- before taking the medication. Seems to retain efficacy; COMPLETELY eliminate stomach problems and GREATLY reduce grogginess -though that also seems to be partly dependent on how much sleep I get (minimum of 6 hours; preferably 8 or 9). Now that I discovered this trick; I am feeling MUCH better and no longer considering abandoning the medication! I like that it helps with sleeping quality on top of helping me focus; remember; and feel more aware of surroundings. Would cry now if I had to go back to not using it - I almost can't function without medication; and the non-stimulant allows me to sleep SO much better and I do not "crash" from it!
patient,25,female,ADD,Depression; Anxiety,Synthroid,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,3,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,80 MG  taken once a day for the period of one month,My ability to focus improved and I was overall calmer. ,Severe depression and thoughts of death.,I found myself staring at the wall more than anything else. I felt totally drugged. My personality changed from somewhat lively to something very dull. It was as if the medication numbed my senses. I discontinued Strattera after one month. I couldn't tolerate the depression anymore.
patient,32,female,ADD,mild depresion/anxiety,none,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,4,Marginally Effective,Mild Side Effects,40/80  (dosage frequency: once daily in the morning)  for the period of 3 weeks,The 1st week  felt great.  All the racing thoughts were gone.  Mind was kinda empty and quiet.  I could concentrate.  I was able to think of a task that needed done and complete it.  Then move on to the next task.  Was only able to work on 1 thing at a time instead of going from one thing to the next without finishing anything. Could listen to the person talking to me without starting to day dream and lose the conversation. Was very happy with it.  ,1st 2 days had nothing in my head.  No thoughts at all.  Didn't talk because there was nothing to say.  I could understand people talking to me; but didn't have responses.  Kinda groggy. Took a nap on the 1st day; which is something I never do.  In my third week; feel like its stopped working.  Minds not racing like before; but feels like all my thoughts are blurry. Feel very blah; not motivated at all. Could sit all day and do nothing.  Before meds I ran around all day from one thing to the next and not finish anything.  I could be in the middle of folding laundry; then walk away to do the dishes.  I couldn't take my kids with me to the grocery store because their talking would distract me and I would forget things.  Taking a list wouldn't help because I couldn't write lists.  Now; I don't even want to do the laundry.  I don't want to do anything.  I wondering if changing the dose will help.   ,Started out on 40ml.  Which I thought was kinda high because I only weigh 118.  Was told to go to 80ml after only 3 days.  I did that and could not sleep at all!  Was awake for at least 48 hours.  So the doc had me go back down to 40ml.  Which isn't working now.

I suggest that while you take the medication you assert a greater self-awareness. As you examine how it affects you; you can understand when you are thinking naturally or by the drug.
patient,40,male,ADD,depression,Effexor XR,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,3,Marginally Effective,Moderate Side Effects,25mg  taken 1 per day for the period of 1 month,Strattera seemed to give me some energy and focus for a few hours.  However; about 5-6 hours after taking the pill; I get sleepy and groggy.  I have never taken a stimulant (newly diagnosed ADD); but this sounds familiar to the "crash" I hear people talking about.  So far the sleepiness and fatigue are out-weighing the benefits of this drug for me.,See above.  Sleepiness and groggy-ness about 6 hours after dose.  I also feel irritable during the "sleepy" time; probably due to the fatigue factor.  I have noticed that little things get me irritated more easily while on Stattera.,I have not noticed any appetite reduction; but it has raised my blood pressure.  I hear stimulants do that too; so I'm growing tired of messing with Strattera when I am getting stimulant side-effects with none of the stimulant benefits.

Able to complete a task before starting another one.  More attentive to what is happening/being said around me. Less impulsive (e.g.; when not taking; will start singing or behaving silly at inappropriate times),None,I'm not sure what this means other than I was started on 40mg once per day and then increased to 80mg where I have remained for 5 years.   
care giver,7,male,ADHD,None,None,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,20mg  taken every day for the period of 6 months,Strattera helped my son slow down without making him groggy or taking away from his personality.,My son became a little whiney in the evening when the medication started to wear off.,I have always known that my son had ADHD; evan as a baby.  I started looking into medication last year.  My son was in 1st grade and had already been suspended from school 3 times.  He also was in the principals office at least 3 times a week.  He was not able to sit still or focus and was having trouble making friends because of his temper.  My husband was against medication; but I talked him into a non-stimulant. We tried Intuniv first; but; that dropped his blood pressure to a dangerous level. Then we found Strattera; our miracle drug.  Within a week we noticed a HUGE difference.  My sons outburst of rage had completely stopped.  This year he hasnt been to the principals office once and his grades are mostly A's with a few B's.  He has also become very popular this year and is invited to almost every Birthday party. I cant tell you how hard it is to see every child in the class invited to birthday parties except your son.  The best part is he is still himself.  The medication doesnt make him groggy or zombie like.  I dont know what we would have done without this drug.  The only side effect we noticed was that he would get a little more whiney than usual in the evening; when the medication was wearing off.  Other than that; we havent noticed any other side effects.  Thank you Strattera

patient,27,female,Bipolar,difficultly concentrating; difficultly completing tasks,Neurontin; Risperdol,Strattera (Atomoxetine) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,40 mg  taken once a day for the period of 7 months,The treatment helped the patient focus on her daily tasks and enabled her to 'get going' in the morning.  In turn; the patient was able to exercise daily which also helped her maintain concentration throughout the day.  Daily exercise also helped her maintain her moods at a stable level.,At first the patient took the medication before she went to bed; which kept her awake at night and did not allow her to sleep.  After a couple of week with inadequate sleep; she sought help and the doctor prescribed her sleeping medication; Ativan.  It turned out that the poor sleep was due to taking the medication improperly.  When that was corrected; the patient was able to sleep again and was able to function at a high rate.,The patient is being treated for bipolar I disorder; with the most recent episode severe depression.   Being bipolar; she is not able to take anti-depressants as this may induce mania.  Therefore strattera is an effective alternative which enables the patient to function at a higher level thus treating some forms of depression.  Other drugs are taken in combination with strattera to help the patient function at an optimal level each day.

Started a low-dose and increased over a period of 3 months.  I believe Wellbuterin was very beneficial and did not have major side effects.  I stopped taking them 2 months ago and haven't had any withdrawal symptoms.

patient,33,female,Depression,dysmenorhea,loestrin fe 24,Wellbutrin XL (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,150 mg  taken daily for the period of past 7 months,This drug definately does have an effect on depression.  I went on a trip and while I had enough for the duration of the trip; I ran out the day I returned and was unable to get the refill for several days.  I noticed a significant change in my mood and affect and began experiencing symptoms of depression again.  Although I tried to keep a "stiff upper lip" my husband noticed the change.,At the beginning of treatment I noticed a slightly elevated heart rate and I felt a bit jittery.  However; I do consume a fairly high amount of caffeine during the day and I was told to expect this by my doctor.  Another effect that I didn't really connect to the medication was a lack of motivation.  I did not attribute this specifically to the medication until I had a conversation with my best friend who had also taken Wellbutrin at one point.  She asked me specifically if I had experienced diminshed motivation while on the drug and it "clicked" with me.  I am not entirely certain if this can be attributed solely to the medication since this is also a symptom of depression.,I feel that this is a useful drug for depression.  I began taking it after my father died.  He battled cancer for 3 years and I took care of him the entire time.  His loss was debilitating to me.  No pill is going to change what I went through or how I feel; but this drug has helped me explore some of the painful feelings that go along with his death without "coming unglued".  My doctor prescribed this for me and at the same time switched me from Ortho-Tricyclen (which I was highly loyal to) to Loestrin Fe 24.  I must say that between these two drugs; physically I feel ten years younger (I am 33 but I feel 23 again).  Overall I would rate this drug as successful for me and will continue on it as long as my doctor and I feel is appropriate for me.

I was better able to cope with every day decisions; events that stressed me with out crying or having angry episodes.  My moods have become stabilized since about a month after the start of taking this medicine.,I tried two other medications prior to using Wellbutrin and was quite pleased!  I had mild dry mouth for about a month and actually lost the weight i gained from prior meds and a bit more.  I still have shaking hands but it is not any worse than a cup of coffee.  I have found that my tolerance to alcohol has increased; and lately my lower back has been hurting in the area of my kidneys; but i also have lower back spasms so i could be projecting worry that the combination of Wellbutrin and wine are doing major damage to my liver and kidneys!,I started taking 150mg of Wellbutrin from April 15 to 30 in 2005 and then increased to 300mg.  I tried to take 450mg about a year ago because I felt the medicine did not seem to be working as well; but I wound up not benefiting from that dose.  I also tried to add Lexapro and gained so much weight I had to stop that medicine. I was given a generic version for about a month and I believe the pills were expired or tainted because the smelled rancid and my behavior patterns went haywire!

I tried the Wellbutrin XL in the hopes that it would not produce this side effect starting about 18 months ago.

I started to take this just before my child was born; having had post partum depression with another baby; and I was anticipating my life to be at least as hectic; if not more hectic; when this child was born as when the older child was born. I was very  pleased with the antidepressant effects. I never experienced any depression at all once this baby was born. I did not experience hypomania like I did with sertraline; which was a huge concern of mine. I just did not become depressed when this baby was born. ,Wellbutrin can make me feel anxious; which is why I have a prescription for clonazepam whenever I am taking wellbutrin. The worst side effect was the cost. I have no health insurance and wellbutrin xl is very expensive. I did not notice weight loss; as some others have; nor did I ever notice an increase in my libido.

It's not supposed to affect weight and hunger; but I have gained some weight; though I don't know if or how the medicine contributed.,Before using Wellbutrin I had trouble getting to sleep; then trouble getting up in the morning. I was very irritable; depressed and frustrated. I always felt groggy and could not 'get it together' until late in the day. When my treatment began; I started by taking one 150 mg pill first thing in the morning for a week. Then I took one 150 mg pill in am and one 150 mg pill in pm (this was before XL came out). The third week and from then on I took 300 mg in morning. I felt so much better that I was not bothered by the slight let down in the evening. However;I didn't feel really well consistently all day until the XL formula came out. I have tried the generic and I don't feel as well and I had constant stomach aches to the point that I was having pain near my gall bladder and was considering being evaluated for gallstones. All of this cleared up when I went back to Wellbutrin XL and I have not had a problem since.

I had a tendency to get unnerved and anxious at the smallest things and since taking Wellbutrin; my husband has noticed a huge difference in my disposition.  I was not a majorly depressed person; just mildly depressed and fatigued; and also becoming uninterested in activities that I used to enjoy.

A big contributer to my depression was weight gain that accompanied it; and as a result my doctor prescribed wellbutrin because typically the patient either stays the same or loses weight will taking it; as opposed to almost every other anti-depressent which can cause weight gain. ,Very minimal side effects. Only noticable thing is that you can feel the pill wear off near bed time and that can cause a sudden spike in appetite.,The wellbutrin helped me regain control of my appetite and as a result i took back control of my happiness and wellbeing.

Also; out of all depression medication I have taken since 1994; I have been able to stop taking Wellbutrin the longest before depression symptoms returned; so I believe eventually I may be able to stop taking Wellbutrin and not have depression symptoms return.,Basically no side effects that I have noticed.  Possibly slightly decreased sex drive but nothing compared to other depression medications I have taken.  Does not cause weight gain; and may actually cause minimal weight loss.  Supposedly may act as stimulant so recommended to take in the a.m.  I have noticed maybe slight stimulant effect.,I pill daily.  I take the medication in the a.m.

That has been fantastic. I have noticed some appetite suppression too; which seems to sort of come and go; but it's definitely a welcome side effect. I have been able to get A LOT done at work; which is never a bad thing; but it's also unpredictable thus far. I also enjoy not having to deal with the nausea and overall sickness I would experience if I missed a dose of Zoloft. ,I'm still sorting out the side effects. I keep having waves of anxiety and depression interspersed with days of feeling great. I have noticed I'm more quick to anger; which isn't really all that bad. Makes me realize I'm FEELING things fully. I have had some difficulty sleeping and loss of appetite; sometimes good; sometimes a little alarming.,I decided that I wanted to go off Zoloft because; while on it; I still experienced some depressive episodes and a terrible loss of libido. I felt out of control and wanted to reclaim that part of myself so I tapered slowly off of Zoloft... which was very difficult; as it can make one very very sick; with flu-like symptoms. While tapering off I began taking the 150 mg dose of Wellbutrin. I still don't feel 100% treated; if one ever can; but I am happy to have myself back; even if I'm not always as good as I want to be!

After taking the medication I felt like I could cope with my problems and my day to day activity was more managable with what was happening with my personal life. I was told by my physician this medication could be taken long term if needed. I know some medication of this type can make you feel spacey.

It did not; however; decrease my appetite which is does for many people who take it.,Given for major depression.  One 150mg pill per day.  I still take the same dosage as I started out on.

I was unfocused; angry; anxious and had racing thoughts.  Wellbutrin XL helped with depression; unfocused thinking and racing thoughts.  I was more focused during the day and was able to complete tasks.  It also helped so that I would not fly off the handle and it helped me stay out of bed.  In a nutshell; it helped me with energy.  A main help was with the sexual side effects of Lexapro; a seratonin reuptake inhibitor.  Lexapro would dimish my libido and make it difficult to reach orgasm.  Wellbutrin really helped to conteract these side effects and gave me even energy during the day.,The only side effects from Wellbutrin is that sometimes I had difficulty getting to sleep if I took the dose later in the day (past noon).,The treatment includes Wellbutrin XL 300 mg.  This is a time released tablet and delivers medication during the day.  In addition; I would take Lexapro 5 to 10 mg for the aggitation and racing thoughts.  This was really helpful with anger and outbursts.  If I had trouble sleeping I would take Trazadone 10 mg at night; and if I did not have it I would take Simply Sleep or Tylenol PM; but only one tablet.  Sometimes I would cut the Trazadone in half for a 5 mg dose.  I have had low grade anxiety and depression for many years.  I have been menopausal for 4 years.  I have a lot of stress in my life with two teenage boys and we live in a high end community outside D.C. with cut throat competition on every corner.

Since starting to take wellbutrin my sex drive returned; my ambition and motivation returned.  On my last medication I was going to sleep at 8 p.m and sleeping until morning then requiring a nap in the afternoon and now I sleep 7-8 hrs a night and have enough energy to get through most of my days.  I had a 5 lb weight loss in the beginning that I have maintained.  Over all I feel I am managing my depression better than I have at any time in the past. ,Side effects in the beginning were a bit of anxiety that eventually past but recently I have been having trouble concentrating; my memory has been poor.  Generally I feel like my iq has dropped  I have also been very teary and find myself crying a fair amount over small incidences almost like I was pregnant.  None of this may have anything to do with the medication but I am concerned. ,I went up to 450mg once a day but cut back to 300mg a day about 6-8 mnths ago and didn't find I was less able to cope with my depression. I do find that I feel depressed more often but I recognize the signs of the depression and use coping stragies to deal with what is happening.

Although I know it's a dream I wake up with the feelings and emotions as if it all just happened. Also have had panic attacks in my dreams and woken up having actual panic attacks in real life. Also; I have read up alot about this drug because I like to know what I'm taking and what could happen... no one has said anything about how hungry you get an hour or so after taking it. I normally don't eat in the morning I haven't since I was 12. But after taking this the hunger pains are so extreme I am forced to eat in the morning when taking it.,So far so good; I will take crazy dreams every night for all the other benefits.

Over the passt 15 years I've been given every anti-depressant the doctors could think of.  Most had no effect at all; some had such uncomfortable side effects that I couldn't take them long enough to find out if they would help at all.  One (I can't remember the name) actually lifted my depression almost immediately and made me feel great; but after about 3 weeks I was suddenly plunged into a depression that was darker and more frightening than any I'd experienced before.  I stopped taking it.  ,The side effects I experienced with Celexa were heart palpitations during the first few weeks of taking it; which later subsided.

The edginess; nervousness; impatience; fear of socializing and going out of the house; completely disappeared after one month of taking it. My close friends even commented that 'I was my old self again'. I was much more relaxed and happy. It made me realize that I was misdiagnosed as depressed; when what I really have is anxiety. After talking to my new psiquiatrist; we came to that conclusion.,COMPLETE loss of libido. That's why I discontinued the treatment.,I started with 10mg/day; for one month; when I started to feel less anxious; but not motivated or more energetic; as expected from an anti-depressive medication. Then the dose went up to 20mg/day for another 3- 4 months; when no 'anti-depression' effects were noticed; the dose went up to 30 mg/day; it made no difference either. I have stopped taking it gradually (20mg/day for 1 week; then 10mg/day for 3 weeks) until i stopped completely. Now I'm waiting to see how I feel; to see if I 'll try another medication; since the side effect described above was intolerable to me.

My problem was that small daily stresses tended to become much larger than they should have. I am now much more able to let small things roll off my back. ,I have gained weight.

So i tried celexa and loved it initially; but i guess you can say that i dint like it because it worked too well!  I completely changed.  I didnt care much about going out or what people and friends thought about me.  Im a contractor and started to get a feeling of not wanting to go on lots of bids or work long hours like i use to want to...which caused a big drop in income.  Paying bills at the last secound; started smoking again etc. I just had that 'i dont give a shyt about anything' attitude. For me this drug completely changed me for the worst.

At the time; (being a teenager) I was frequently tired anyway. I think this is why I did not notice the side effect at first. But years later; I decided to try going off it; and discovered an increase in energy and motivation. After that; I tried a few other drugs like lexipro (which gave me the same side effects); and Wellbutrin (which made me feel manic; highly anxious and stressed). I had tried the Wellbutrin because I was told it would not make me sleepy. Unfortunately; in increased my anxiety to the extreme. Recently; I have gone to a therapist and with some therapy; I am no longer on any drugs. This is what I should have done in the first place.

This med allowed me to function again within my family and within the working world.  I stopped crying all the time and was able to concentrate and perform the tasks necessary for employment.  I got my life back.,Unlike other antidepressants with numerous side effects; this med had no internal side effects.  The only complaint I had with this med was the skin irritation at the application site.  This I treated with moisturizers and hydrocortisone creams.,I simply applied one patch daily to any part of the "trunk" area of my body.  It was not a drug I had to be introduced to slowly or weaned off of.  I found that the lowest dose available was effective for me.

This is the first medication that has worked for any length of time. (Paxil worked for a short period of time but maxed out w/o further benefit even with augmentation).,The worst side effect I had was insomnia. At first; insomnia was OK because I was; for the first time; happy to be alive and being happy more hours of the day seemed hunky-dory. Of course sleep-deprivation isn't good for the brain and started to wear on my job performance. Tried many different sleep agents to no avail. (I have absolute tolerance to anything ending in -pam apparently). For the longest time I could sleep no more than 1-2 hours per night (but felt rested). I'm up to 4-5 hours (pre-med normal amount) without any sleep meds.,looking to augment now. After being on 12 mg for most of a year; "atypical" symptoms (overeating; oversleeping) returning and 12 mg is max dosage. Even so; I still feel better than I ever had previous to taking EMSAM.

The medication certainly made life much more enjoyable and enabled me to cope with general situations much better. Reduced general irritability.  I took this medication during two pregnancies and found no ill effects of the new borns.,Some anxiety; especially when beginning this medication. Hyperhidrosis of axillae; which I found the most frustrating side effect. Severely reduced libido. Lethargy and general tiredness.,I commenced this treatment due to clinical depression. I started off at a dose of 20mg a day and after initial improvement found that I needed an increase in the dose to 40mg per day. This seems to work more effectively for me. I became pregnant after approximately 10 months on the medication. I continued on with the same dose throughout the entire pregnancy. I did not breast feed. I then became pregnant very quickly again and continued on the medication for this pregnancy as well. Once again I did not breast feed. I have at times reduced my dose to 20mg which has been fine; however if I suffer a depressive episode I increase it to 40mg and generally find this is what I need to stay on.

I can take more stress at work; in my romantic life; and family situations where as before; I would crawl under a rock and cry. A lot of people say that they don't feel much on this drug; but I think it was low enough to where I could have moderate lows and elevated highs. It helped me control my impulsive behavior with eating.,I had headaches if I didn't take it with enough food in my stomach. I also have insomnia; however; if you cut your intake of caffeine; it shouldn't be too severe.,I took this at noon. It's a strange feeling on this drug because later in the day; I feel a bit strange. Either way; I know what people mean when they say that they feel a lot of indifference come over them at times they should be feeling overwhelming emotions. This drug helps me cope and sometimes I feel like I don't need it anymore; but I go right back on it when I feel the blues creeping up on me again.

In fact it seemed to make me more anxious.,Anxiety,I was prescribed this because of anxiety and mild depression by my GP but it did not improve my condition and seemed to make my anxiety worse.  My anxiety was partly due to my personality and partly due to the fact that I had a mentally ill son which caused me a lot of worry and stress.   My GP thought that SSRI's may help and prescribed fluoxetine.   This did not help and he changed me to Cipramil which suited me better as it did not make my anxiety worse but it did not really help my anxiety that much so I stopped taking this as well.

I have always had good results with it; but I wanted to go off it to have children. Then; after my last child; I tried to make it without medication; but I realized I couldn't. I am very careful about the medications I take and I don't like being stuck on anything. However; I realized that I needed help and my children needed a happy Mommy. I went back on Prozac (the generic form) 2 months ago and now feel better than I have in years. I can cope with the daily stresses of life without losing my temper; or my mind. I can face the responsibilities of each day without fear; hopelessness; or doubt. I can laugh and enjoy my children. I am truly a new person. I am regretting not going back on this medication sooner.,Honestly; the only side effect I have had is that it is harder to have an orgasm. I can still have them; but it just takes longer. I don't really feel "in the mood" as much; but that is a very small detriment compared to what I was experiencing before. I have had no other side effects whatsoever. I do not even feel "mediciney" or out of it at all and no stomach problems; either.,I am planning on seeing my doctor every 6 months and have my blood checked once a year to check my liver; etc.; but so far am doing great. I do see a counselor every 2 weeks; which is invaluable to me.

However; within one week my appetite was as great as ever. Given that this medication is not covered by insurance; its virtual ineffectiveness is particularly noteworthy.,none,Patient is supposed to take it first thing in the morning so that its time release qualites have the longest impact. One is told that after a month or so you may need to boost your dosage to continue to experience benefits. However; for me; the benefit lasted only 1 week! Not worth it!

Didn't get hunger urges as often and started to loose weight as decreased my calorie intake,Insomnia; headaches; nausea; increased heart rate,Reductil gave me a motivational start to healthy eating and decreasing my portion sizes. Because of low sugar levels I always feel hungry and it gave me some relief as I didnt get hungry as often and when I ate; I couldnt eat as much; but I felt satisfied. I felt that the effects of the drug started to ware off after a few months but now I dont take it anymore as I have lost about 5 kilos and want to continue to lose another 5 through healthy controlled eating and exercise. I feel I can control my eating a bit better and realised that the overeating was creating the roller coaster ride; so I think the drug helped me mentally with portion control and now I tell myself as I have created the habbit with better eating habbits.

Mild occasional insomnia,Taken once a day it acts as a mood lifter and helps you feel full with less food.  It helped me take off a few pounds.  However; it is only a tool and patient has to be diligent about monitoring hunger and deciding to limit portions.  It's easy to "eat around" the drug and overeat. For short term weight loss or to help lose 10 -15 lbs it is great. VERY expensive...$125 for one months supply.

The key was drinking water all throughout the day. I ate 1 meal a day before 6pm & snacked on fruit (applesauce; fruit cups; canned fruit;etc.)  all through the day (instead of fast food; icecream; chips or any other food that is unhealthy). I saw no results in the first month; but once 30 days had passed; I started to lose 1 lb. a day & sometimes 1 1'2 lb. a day. Even after getting off of Meridia; I still continued to lose weight 2 months later. Product was VERY expensive but worth it! The more weight you have to lose the more you WILL lose!,Insomnia sometimes. My bedtime(before Meridia) was around 10pm but once I began taking the medicine; I couldn't sleep sometimes until 12am or 1am; but even with lack of sleep; I never felt fatigued like I thought I would. Every once in a while; mild headaches & dry mouth. But nothing too major or life-threatening.,Lost 91 lbs. in 6-7 months. Kept the weight off even to this day (4 years later) b/c the Meridia taught me the key to weight loss: Less calorie intake. And since the Meridia trained my body to get full quicker; I was able to still eat & crave less even after getting off of the medication.

After stopping the drug there was a gradual weight gain of 10lbs until weight settled and has been maintained for 3 years. Health has improved and an increase in fitness and regular exercise has been maintained.Benefits have outwayed the side effects as all other attempts over the years to lose weight had failed; and there is a family history of heart disease.,Side effects at the time included worsened insomnia and irregular menstruation ( already suffered from before starting drug; but worse while taking it) and mood swings. Insomnia and irregular menstruation have continued; mood swings have improved but both continued conditions may have worsened naturally anyway due to naturally occurring early peri-menopause as there is a family history of this.,Drug dosage reccomendations were not followed; and only taken in the morning as this lessened the side effects.

Settled into Meridia's Program provided over the Internet (comes with perscription).  Promised myself to follow the rules.  The toughest for me; was not to weigh myself everyday.  Meridia wanted me to check only once a week and I'm glad I refrained.  The thrill of seeing a huge difference each week has kept my knees from complaining.  The strength of Meridia has never lessened.  If I forget to take it; I feel like the bottom of my floor has opened up and I am in free fall.  It really is strange...  When I take it with my vitamins each morning; it gives me a definite feeling of support.  I am loosing 2 lbs each week along with inches.  I'm doing better than what they advertise but that is probably because I have a gym in my home.  I walk 70 miles/mo. and do free weights.  I also love my whey protein porrage in the morning with blueberries; shake for lunch and balanced meal for dinner.  I do eat snacks.  A Starbucks coffee (also made at home); with 1/2 an energy bar... or; an orange.  Responsible eating.  I also understand the dynamics of over eating; being menopausal with depleated hormones.  Meridia has been a life saver for me.  Thanks to my fabulous Doctor; who is also using it.  ,In 2 mo. (3/4 of the program); 22 lbs weight loss.,3 months; 1 capsule of 10 mg. per day.  After 3 mo.; back in to see my Doctor for another check-up.  Continuing on Meridia for another 3 months for achievement of goal.  According to my Doctor; I can use it as a maintenance.  I honestly have no side effects.  I just wish it wasn't so expensive.

On days that I forgot to take a capsule; I did feel hungry and it was not as easy to stick to my diet.,There were no side effects that I could trace directly to Meridia. Mild constipation is a possible side effect; but that could also have been due to dehydration.,I took one Meridia first thing in the morning and then stuck to a sensible diet for the day.  If I took the Meridia too late in the day; it did keep me from sleeping well that night.

I don't know if my stomach has shrunk or if I just have a better idea of how much to eat and what to do to lose weight; regardless I'm thrilled and couldn't be happier with the results!

It seems that this happens in two ways; first; I do feel full most of the time; even though I feel some low blood sugar weakness that comes with weight loss.  The other part is that I just don't seem to care as much about eating; feeling weak; full; ect.  This is a nice mental shift which makes my weight loss plan feel like natural; like a life style change.  I just don't care about food that much and am able to think about other things.  Also; I have noticed that I when I am tempted to snack; I am able to see that I am usually emotionally stressed about something; so it is easier to think of another way to deal with my emotions and anxiety.  It is not a miracle drug.  I still have to stick to my plan and focus on meal preparation.  Also; it took 1 and a half weeks to really start working in my system.  It did not help my hunger the first week.  Just give it some time to build up in your body!,At first I felt increased nervousness and anxiety.  After about ten days; it lifted my mood and began to take away my appetite.  Then the nervousness went away.  It is harder for me to fall asleep and to sleep as deeply as before; but some of this happens when ever I loose weight.,Take first thing in the morning with breakfast.  I eat three meals with two snacks a day and drink loads of water and iced tea.  You have to drink enough for this drug to work.  You need WAY more water; as much as possible.  then you really will feel full most of the time.

After 4 monhts; BMI is 28.  Lost 43 pounds.  Increased energy and confidence.  Another benefit was an increase in alertness and confidence.  I had low blood pressure and was quite passive before; and with the medication felt an increase in energy and heart rate.  My behaviour changed - I became more assertive because I was more impatient than before.,Increased heart rate.  After day 9 on Meridia; felt hungry when my body was hungry - constant hunger stopped.,After day 9 on the medication; I no longer had that feeling of starving all the time. When I started Meridia; I also started the Jenny Craig program to educate myself on nutrition and get support.  My knowledge of nutrition was so limited that a nutritionist would not have been able to teach me such basic principles - I needed to be taught like a child.  I didn't know this at the time; but 4 monhts later; I know that was the right thing to do and why.

Also you're not drink alcohol at all and its become your habit ) Cause M. is not compatible with drinking. You have a lot of energy; do not thinking what to eat; where to eat and etc.. No any narcotic pleasure or panic; I had no any psyho effects at all. Only sleeping less may be.  ,If you have a bottle of water; no any side effects. The main effect - you start to love yourself when you look at the mirror; cause you see results. BUT I think it's not killing appetit at all. You only have (If its possible to say so) more willing force to refuse of extra eating. But the motivation and decision are still your choice. Frankly speaking If you don't want to slim and still force yourself to eat as best habit; M. will not work. More you eat then more you want to eat.   )),1 caps (15 or 20 mg.; don't remember now) per day; at morning. No any dependance; you can take it or not. But you'll see how much more is your lack of willingness and dream to be thin without it))
patient,41,female,joint/muscular issues - fibro,sleep issues due to pain but was alleviated by meds,advil for occassional pain during the day,Nortriptyline ,Antidepressants Norepinephrine-Reuptake-Inhibitors,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,25mg  taken once a day for the period of 5 years,ability to sleep though the night decreasing joint/muscle pain and cramps allowing for a more productive day,none once proper dosages were found....higher mg's made me "foggy",when I was not able to sleep the pain would increase which would lead to a cycle of not being able to sleep as I could not relax..the meds would help me to sleep which would allow my body to relax - this in turn led to a decrease in my symptoms..though there were still times when this would not be effective; such as if I was under high levels of stress or could not get 8 hours of sleep..if the condition continued for to long; severe depression; weepiness and other symptoms would begin to appear - usually a week of prescription sleep aides would help "re-set" my system and we could get back to the original program.
patient,52,female,Originally depression; later for chronic pain,endometriosis; chronic migraines; fibromyalgia; CFS,liquid advil; clonazepam,Nortriptyline ,Antidepressants Norepinephrine-Reuptake-Inhibitors,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,50 mg  taken 1 time at bedtime for the period of many years; still taking it,good lifting of depressive feelings; reduction in chronic back pain associated with endometriosis and fibromyalgia,Dry mouth and shaky hands . Shakiness subsided in 3-4 days  ,would highly recommend a trial of this if you have any chronic pain issues at all.  Although other pain meds may have to be taken occasionally due to severity changes the Nortriptyline for me really cuts that down.
patient,28,female,back pain; restlessness,Insomnia,ibprofen,Nortriptyline ,Antidepressants Norepinephrine-Reuptake-Inhibitors,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,1 capsule before bed  taken every night until caught up on sleep for the period of off and on for 2 months,taken properly; it can be very helpful.,Drowsiness if not enough time is available to sleep.  8 hours.,To treat aches and pain associated with back pain and insomnia.
patient,43,female,shooting nerve-type pain in legs/fibromyalgia,fibromyalgia; neuralgia,none,Nortriptyline ,Antidepressants Norepinephrine-Reuptake-Inhibitors,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,25 mg per day  taken once at night for the period of 2 years,excruciating; shooting nerve pain in my left leg stopped after about a week although I could still feel that the nortriptyline just masked the pain ie. In the past 6 months I have got down to 12.5 mg per day although a recurrence of the terrible shooting pain (after 2 years) had made me decide to try Gabapentin instead- my doc recommends this, Fuzziness of thinking/short term memory loss- although this might be due to my fibromyalgia. Sexual disfunction- ie inability to have a full orgasm- and after 2 years of this; thi sis one of the reasons why I am ready to change to Gabapentin- as recommended by my doc. Sleepiness etc goes away after the first few weeks although it took me a good 6 months to properly adapt to this drug, 10mg at night for the first 6 months; then the pain came through again so I upped this to 25mg per day. Six months ago; I wasn;t aware of any pain behind the pain that I had been used to so; thinking I was maybe a bit better; I cut the intake down to 12.5 mg a day by cutting my 25mg tablet in half each night. this was fine until a week ago when the shocking shooting pain returned accompanied by pin-prick sensations on my face and on my limbs- I've not had thi sin 2 years. I intend to try gabapentin now; although some people have referred to it as the 'zombie drug'. My main reason for not upping the Nortrip back to 25mg; is that I want to see if I will be able to have an orgasm on the Gaba- although maybe this is a luxury- as anyone with nerve pain knows; sex is the last thing on your mind when you are in such pain. But who knows; maybe I will be able to be pain-free and get my libido back...!

I also do have headacheds that seem to come from ears and the back of my neck.  It help me feel better and started to decrease my symptoms but side effects were worse than original symptoms.  It helped me to ignore my symptoms and helped me to get through the day.,ringing in the ears; sensitivity to noise; phantom noise in head; which all lead to anxiety,stopped medicine; looking for something else to help.

Able to live life again. Life is much lighter. I am no longer oversensitive; things like life's little injustices don't hurt so much anymore. My daily experiences in this initial period can be followed on: http://nortriptyline.blogspot.com/ where I am keeping a diary. This is for the benefit of others who are indecisive and want to know more details before embarking on a course of medication themselves with nortriptyline.,So far all the side effects seem temporary. Cold hands/feet; white face. Bad taste in mouth. Fuzzy in the beginning. Nothing serious so far.,So far the treatment is only to take one tablet a day; and occasionally an Oxazepam in the first two weeks; if I am afraid of falling back into a depression. I started taking both for the first three days; but will soon leave off the Oxazepam. We'll see what happens; it can be followed on my above-mentioned blog. In any case so far I am happy I am taking this medication; I feel much better. I was severely depressed when I started taking it; but the depression seems quite suppressed now.

During the last few years; when I have been stable and very happy; I have tried several times to cease the medication; including under the support of a naturopath. This medication is very hard to get off without significant side effects (including vertigo and nausea); however; as my medicxal professional has stated; some people just need to stay on them for a longer time. ,I have been on 20mg (one tablet) of Paroxetine for around 5 years now; as well as see a psychologist for 6 months.

I struggled with appetite actually and at times had to force myself to eat.,I miss doses of the paxil; especially 2 or more in a row; I feel like I did when I just started them.  I can barely get out of bed and function.  I'm super sleepy.  I feel drunk.  I'm dizzy.  I will literally go missing for 2 days.  It takes a few days of regular doses to get me back into my normal mode.,Initially I was only prescriped paxil and xanax.  I took only these for a few months under my PMD.  Dose was increased from a lower one to 20mg as my depression and anxiety symptoms were still moderately severe; impairing my work performace and other quality of life.  Withing a few months I was referred to a psychiatrist for med mgmt. After less than 6 months; Wellbutrin was added to the cocktail at a dose of 150mg; then increased to 300mg XL once daily.  Ambien was also presccribed as my symptoms did not allow me to fall asleep.  Life greatly improved within the next 8 months to a year.  I weaned off the ambien and xanax completely.  Still take the paxil and wellbutrin at the same doses.  Also had counseling during all of this time.

I am able to play with the kids without unhappily obsessing over all the things I should be working on. I can just chill out and be in the moment. ,sleepiness the next day; maybe more acne,Clinical depression runs in my family. My sister was clinically depressed at the age of 9. She and I were both sensitive; angry; sad; and sometimes suicidal. I have just lived with it; not really taking meds much. I have to notice a difference in a few days if I am going to stick with something. My aunt told my sister that the people in our family do well on Paxil. My sister felt that it worked for her for a year or two; so I started taking it because it has reached a point where I have to be happy or die from stress. the Paxil had a noticeable effect on my anxiety levels in a matter of days; and an effect on my level of general happiness in a matter of a week or two. The doctor prescribed 20 mg which I just can't take because it makes me too sleepy the next day. I take 10mg which was enough for the first month. Now 10 mg is almost not enough; I can feel the anxiety there sometimes but more Paxil will make me sleepy. My 10 year old son inherited the family depression problem; he's been talking about killing himself and others. He started taking Paxil also; I have noticed a big difference. He is not angry so much anymore. It is helping us truly. I usually won't take prescriptions; I think they make people sicker sometimes. I will keep taking this stuff as long as the benefits outweigh the problems.

This reached the maximum level after about 5 weeks.  I experienced very high levels of confidence and an ability to focus much more on my goals.  This led to successful achievement and a dramatic move forward in my life.,A greatly lowered libido and extremely vivid dreams.,I was prescribed the drug at 20 mg a day.  For the first three weeks I took it in the morning but; due to severe drowsiness; after 20 days I began to administer it just before bedtime.  This resulted in the vivid dreams and led to greater alertness during the day.

I was also able to handle a significant amount of stress in a reasonable manner.,I was very tired; having to nap daily.

Uncomfortable in my skin. Constipation. Horrible to stop taking. Very hard to lessen the dosage and not feel like I was shaking out of my skin. Very edgy; trembles.,I was being treated for adult rheumatic fever with antibiotics and steroids and paxil.  I had a very hard time coming off of the paxil and I was very uncomfortable on it. The mental benefit was not worth the physical detriment.

Normalizing of affect; increased ability to focus on tasks and to cope with minor stressors. I felt a sort of reorganization of my thought processes; no longer brooded interminably about minor failings or ineffective social interactions or the presumed opinions of others about my worth. No longer hypervigilant about social cues. "So this is what it's like to be normal!",Initially; but eventually disappearing side effects: drowsiness; severe nausea; inability to achieve orgasm; trembling; lack of affect. When failing to take medication; "brain shocks" like electrical lightning in brain.,Took 20 mg of paroxetine each morning (easier to remember in the morning).

Introversion diminished and friendly extroversion became more natural.  It was easier to start and finish projects because energy previously wasted on negative thoughts and actions was now available for constructive purposes.,worst part was withdrawal following treatment.  It took at least 6 months of extremely gradual tapering off to withdraw; and I was on a low dose.  Any attempt to withdraw faster would produce chaotic mood swings from hysterical laughter to violent; yelling rages.  Every emotion; however mild; was magnified exponentially.  Sexual sensation also went off the scale with such hypersensitivity that ejaculations happened spontaneously without any physical stimulation - a sneeze or a yawning stretch would morph into an immediate ejaculating orgasm without any erection.  Throughout the withdrawal period a sensation of electric brain shocks extending to the arms and trunk would accompany any quick eye movement.,Just the one pill each morning.  This medication is such a double-edged sword that I could not recommend it.  The long term dangers of sustained treatment are too great; as evidenced by the severe withdrawal effects.  It really 'rewires' your brain and those effects may be unpredictable from person to person.

I no longer have a negative or indifferent attitude towards life.  I am generally content and am capable of enjoyment.  I am still capable of feeling appropriate negative emotions but don't get stuck in them.,I am not aware of any side effects.,I was diagnosed with mild chronic depression.  I took Prozac for approximately two years but it began to no longer work; even after raising the dosage.  My doctor switched to Paxil.  I tried getting off of it on two occasions; but both times; after about two months; the depression returned.  Paxil continues to work for me; however; I am concerned about potential long-term side effects.

I was repeatedly told it wasn't working because I just hadn't been on it long enough and my dosage wasn't high enough. It did not help the depression at all and it was expensive.,Trying to slowly reduce the dosages so the medicine could be stopped resulted in very frequent "brain zaps." These felt like electrical shocks in the head any time I moved. The electrical shocks could be felt in my arm and chest sometimes as well. The only thing that helped was to lay down and be as still as possible; but even that did not stop the shocks. This went on for 6 months. The gradual stepping down of dosage was monitored by a doctor and was even done slower than normal but it did not prevent the "brain zaps." Headaches and some nausea also accompanied the shocks.,Started with 20mg and gradually increased to 50mg. After a year of treatment and no improvement the drug was eventually decreased and stopped.

I feel like the first years of my life would have been very different if I had some treatment for my feelings.  My whole family would agree that I am much much happier and have a feeling of peace in my life.,I am not sure if it is only the drug but I have almost no sexual feelings. Could just be my age...who knows.,I'm not sure what you mean by "treatment details" but I saw a psycotherapist for several months and she prescribed the paxil and ok'd the paroxetine.  I share my treatment with anyone because I think that depression is not the best descriptive word for what was troubeling me.  Thanks for your work!

I felt interested in all my hobbies again plus I was smiling and laughing more.  My doctor told me I could be the poster child for Paxil.  This drug made a remarkable improvement in my mild depressive state.  I recently (5 wks ago) underwent gastric bypass surgery.  The doctor that performed this surgery told me not to quit taking Paxil...it would be like losing my best friend.  I have had absolutely no depression after my surgery (which I understand is not common).  This drug is amazing!,The only side effects I had were temporary decreased sexual desire and a decreased ability to have orgasms.  These side effects went away after about 6 months on this drug.,I take one 20 mg. pill once a day at the same time.  I usually take my pill first thing in the morning because it's easier for me to remember.  I did research on this product before I actually started taking it and found that the 20 mg. dose had the same results as the 40 mg. dose and showed no marked improvement.  The 20 mg. dose has been great for me.

It's been seven years since I went off all drugs and I still have occasional withdrawal symptoms that I call "brain shocks." I don't recommend SSRIs to anyone for anything.

It was a clear day; not much traffic as it was the middle of the day and this freeway is more of a 'country' freeway than our main one; 101.  I pulled over to the shoulder so I could compose myself.  I felt like I was having a panic attack (which I had never had before but friends have) so I took deep; slow breaths to calm myself.  When I felt I was alright; I returned to the freeway but had to pull over once more before I reached home.  I have never been in an accident nor had this feeling before so could not rationalize what was happening. After it happened a few more times; I put paper bags in my car (for breathing) and started using side roads; where I had no problems.  When I went to my doctor; I told him about my anxiety and he prescribed Paxil for me.  I began taking it and; it took a while; though I wasn't ready to try the freeway right away; but it has definitely helped. I am now more willing to just get on the freeway.

Suddenly I was talkative and social; where before I was soft-spoken and hesitant. I behaved as if I could not fail in anything I undertook to do.

My attacks subsided immediately and though they recur every so often the relief has been a godsend. Even as a highly-productive and involved person it has been a lifetime of quiet fear that at any moment I would have these horrific feelings of losing my self and being depersonalized out of my body. As a few others have noted; the most common location for instant attacks is while driving. Paxil has calmed much of my life-long anxiety. I am a calmer and more socially comfortable person.,Lots of side effects; none of them deal breakers. It took months to achieve orgasm - it was like having a dead weight between my legs. Having reduced treatment to 10mgs a few years ago that has improved. As many others report; wild dreams and less deep sleep is now the norm but I have long grown accustomed to it. Miss a dose and you get those weird 'electric' buzz shocls in your brain - a tad alarming but not horrible. Weight increase of about 10 pounds - very difficult to get rid of.,Started at 10 mg on doctor's recommendation; went to 20 after a month. Noticable improvement in mood and lessened anxiety. After 4-5 years weaned myself down to 10 mg by cutting the pills. With doctor ok have stayed at 210 for the last 6 years. Once i tried to reduce it to 5 mg - big mistake. Too big a jump and had terrible anxiety. Decided I could live with 10 mg. It works; but with side effects. Like all powerful medicine; it's a tradeoff. For me it is still worth it 10 years later.

I was hoping for something that I could take only on a "as needed" basis as I've never been one to take medication unless absolutely needed.  My MD does not believe in prescribing that kind of medication due to the highly addictive nature. I do not like the side effects of this drug and do not intend to continue it.

Treatment was accompanied by talk therapy. The withdrawal from the drug itself was difficult; as it led to the emergence of anxiety and panic attacks and a new case of mild depression. 
patient,44,female,ocd,generalized anxiety; allergies,singulair and astelin,Paxil CR (Paroxetine) ,Antidepressants Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,25 mg  taken 1 per day in the evening for the period of since February 2000,I felt reduced anxiety and compulsions;  less need for perfection;  better able to live with "good enough"; less stress and happier; no more depression.,Ihad to stop nursing; constipation (must take 2 stool softeners per day); it killed my sex drive; skipping more than two days causes serious headaches; after three days of missed meds you go into withdrawal...much like heroin withdrawal.  Never have I been so ill or wanted to die.,Along with psychotherapy; I started taking prozac; with no effect after 2 months.  I switched to paxil with constipation and I needed at least 10 hours of sleep to come out of it each morning. I switched to selexa with no effect.  I then tried zyprexa  which caused me to gain 10 lbs in a month; gave me memory loss and I started lactating again.  By then; they had come out with paxil-cr (extended release) and I have been on that ever since.  I would like to switch to something that doesn't kill my sex drive and make me want to die when I go off of it; but I am afraid to stop without the proof of something else working better.
patient,27,female,anxiety/IBS,None.,None.,Paxil CR (Paroxetine) ,Antidepressants Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,10 mg/day  taken daily for the period of 1 year,Significantly and quickly reduced anxiety (within 2 weeks). In turn; digestive problems (IBS) related to anxiety were significantly improved. Greatly improved my quality of life.,As long as treatment was taken consistently; side effects were minimal. This medication does not seem to mix well with alcohol - memory loss and increased intoxication were experienced when alcohol was consumed. If a dosage was missed; side effects included unpleasant sensory experiences (like electrical sparks; "zapping"); dizziness; and disorientation. A strong cautionary statement: withdrawal from this medication may be extremely unpleasant. The overall experience I had with this drug was diminished only by the harsh symptoms associated with discontinuing the drug. The effects included heightened irritability; and strong sensory effects described previously. The drug dosage should be tapered; I quit taking the drug "cold turkey" and in retrospect it was a poor choice. I estimate that it took a couple months to stop experiencing the withdrawal symptoms.,A single 10 mg dose was taken daily. I logged my progress by journaling my emotional and physical state at various points in the treatment.

Took about 4 weeks to really make a difference. However; did notice change after only a couple weeks. I slack off many times and after a day or two of missed pills I notice dizziness and mild headache plus some nausea. Not good to do; but it happens. After being on the medicine as many years as I have; I don't think it is as effective as others may be; but I have tried many...Prozac;Zoloft and numerous others I don't remember the name of and nothing worked as well for me as Paxil..Another note is that anxiety runs in my family and a few aunts and uncles in my family have had the same good luck with Paxil. I often wonder since we are related if it treats something in our brain the same as it seems to work for this family??? Something to think about if you know someone else in your family that suffers from depression or other mental illness.

Basically it leveled me out; where the anxiety didn't affect me anymore.,Getting on the drug was tough; because I endured insomnia; sweating; loss of appetite; high-anxiety; shaking; hands; and restlessness.  After about 2-3 weeks; however; all those symptoms went away; once my body got used to it.  I did have some weight gain; but I was really skinny to begin with. ,I've dealt with anxiety since I was a kid as well as obsessive thinking.  It continued to build until I was 17 and I had a major panic attack; which I could not calm down from.  My psychiatrist put me on Paxil CR and I worked up to 25 mg.  The dosage made a big difference; though I still had moderate levels of anxiety; but I could function.  About a year and a half ago I was hit with another major attack that send me into a relapse for about 2-3 months; then I upped my dosage to 37.5 mg and within a week I felt fine; even better than I felt before.  Now a year and a half later; I found myself in another relapse and after a week I released that all this time I was not at a high enough dosage because my anxiety and obsessive thoughts would still creep in and cause me distress.  So my psychiatrist agreed that I was not at my ideal dosage and I am now taking two 25 mg in the morning which equals 50 mg; which is still a fairly moderate dosage considering other patients that were on 80 to even 120 mg.  I just started taking it; so I should start feeling even better within about a week or two.  I've accepted that I may need to be on this for the long haul; which is fine.  I look at is as nutrition for the brain; or like taking insulin for diabetes; it allows me function and enjoy life.

The benefits were a total feeling of "well-being". Without the extreme "high" feeling of anfetamines (taken before as part of a supervised diet regimen). High decrease on anxiety. Appetite more controled. Clearness of my thoughts. Decrease on crisis of depression (specially during the days previous to my periods). More "energy" during the day to the daily things.. decrease on obsessive compulsive (mild) disorder ,The side effects with the intake of Fluoxetine for me included mild insomnia; headaches (specially in the beginning of the treatment). Loss of appetite. Mild change in the sense of taste. Little bit of nausea after a big meal. Or something very different from the usual food.

For the first time I wanted to work. It gave me the good sensation that I  could do things. I worked and worked like a bee. Therefor; depression was a thing of the past when I take this medication. It help my mind to focus and stay sharp.  I can concentrate better with this medication.,Taking prozac made me more sleepy and I could not get up to do everyday thing. I just kept sleeping or yawning.  I wanted my depresion to go away but it did the opposite. Instead of helping me keep me depresed I felted more depresed because I kept sleeping all the time. The medication Prozac with me did not help my depression but rather calm me to the extent that I did not want to do anything. Also I kept going to the bathroom constantly. It takes down my sexual mood and difficulty in getting aroused at all.  Ritalin cause my mouth to dry up and kept drinking water like a camel. Jittery effect and when the medication wear off you feel it like large thump. ,Doctor suggested to take Prozac at night time and Ritalin twice a day. So far it has worked for me a patient suffering depression for more than 15 years and it has helped me the Ritalin. Cannot say about Prozac but I notice that I do not get anxiety attack with it.

There was also a major decrese in appetite.,This drug resulted in an unanticipated weightloss of over 20lbs - I went from 128 to 108 lbs. The weight loss decresed the incidences of bulimia. The drug was effective in that I no longer felt depressed per se; but then I didn't feel much of anything. Any combination with alcohol should be avioded - majorly increases its effects!

I went from feeling suicidal and not being able to funtion properly in order to take care of myself or my family; to feeling better than I had since I was in my teens. I began to lose some of the weight I had gained from being depressed. I was in a wonderful mood and I had so much more energy than I had in years. My overall experience with Prozac has been perfect!,I have had no known side effects to this date. I do watch out for muscle cramps that last more than a week and I have blood work done once a year to ensure that my kidneys are not being affected.,I started on 10 mgs. once a day and when that was tolerated well I went up to 40 mgs. This caused some insomnia and nervousness so my Dr. lowered it to 20 mgs. a day. There are still times I get depressed for a few days but that only happens once or twice a year and it is mild. I am looking at being on Prozac as long as my body toleates it; due to once being taken off I went into a fast downward spiral and had to begin again.

There may be some effects with sexual attachment on the negative side.,Only the medication is prescribed; no other forms of therapy are being used.  Plan is to stay on medication at this time; due to the percieved stresses of life and fear of going back to what was.

patient,50,female,depression,anxiety; mild psychosis,ativan,Prozac (Fluoxetine) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,60 mg. each morning  taken every day for the period of 18 years,this anti-depressant has basically saved my life.  i have suffered with severe depression and anxiety since childhood.  whether these problems were caused by 'nature or nurture' can be difficult to ascertain; but in my particular case; i believe it was both.  while i was a victim of severe sexual; physical and verbal abuse from a very young age through my teen years; i also seem to have been born with an unusually 'sensitive' disposition; and can get very emotionally and mentally disturbed at times with very little provocation.  everyone who knows me well considers me a very emotional person.  at any rate; it has been the prozac that has helped me in dealing with the stresses of even everyday life.  i first started feeling suicidal in adolescence; and unfortunately; this is still a constant problem.  the prozac; i am convinced; has helped me keep these feelings in check; and although i was just hospitalized for my depression late last year; i am still alive and kicking.  i completely believe that it is the prozac that has saved my life.  before the advent of these types of antidepressants; all that was available were the tricyclics.  those never worked for me the way the ssri's have.  although they did achieve in putting me into a stupor-like condition; they never seemed to alleviate my depression.  the prozac does.  while it doesn't rid me of the problem completely; it has been absolutely invaluable to me; and i believe it is the main reason i am alive to write these words to you today.  i am fortunate in that i have never had a single side effect from the prozac.  actually; there has been a complete loss of libido; which could be a major problem for alot of people;  for me; however; this is not a problem; because i am celibate; and have been for 20 years.  trust me; i had enough sex in my younger years to last me for the rest of my life.  i feel i should mention that i have known many people who take prozac and who have not had any sexual problems at all.,initial dosage was 20 mgs. each morning.  this dosage was sufficient for about 5 years; at which point it was raised to 40 mgs. each day.  ultimately; the dosage was raised again approximately 2-3 years after the first increase to my current dosage of 60 mgs. each day.  this is apparently the maximum dosage.  only side effect was loss of libido.,basically you need to see a psychiatrist as often as your condition requires.  i also recommend concurrent visits with some type of therapist or counselor; as this will increase the benefits you receive by taking the medication.

I decided to end the medication as it was not doing anything as a life benefit. this medication simply masks symptoms so that the patient "feels" functional.And most importantly; I no longer trusted it. I also now believe that DSM diagnois; as used in the general public (myself included) excuses inept doctors from forming medical diagnosis; doing the investigative work and testing to EXCLUDE biological conditions. Why do I think this? My 14 year old daughter "mentally crashed" and it was her thyroid; which affects among other organs THE BRAIN. My thyroid tests has been flucuating; but; since the medical doctor stated " I don't know if I should treat you for hyper or hypothyroid....I got dumped into DSM and prozac. A travesty.

Passed after a fews weeks. Definite drop in libido since treatment started; rated the side effects as "moderate" above for this reason alone.,Take 20 mgs once per day. I have to speak with my Dr by phone every third refill and visit in office twice a year to discuss how treatment in working.

Prozac was effective for the first 5 years then my depression slowly started to become worse. I then had to be placed on Wellbutrin for about 2 years; along with Prozac and yet my side effects from Prozac increassed to the point where I was taken off prozac.,The main treatment side effect began as increased depression and slight shaking in my fingers and hands. Over time the shaking turned into tremors which I could not control. Then I was placed on Wellbutrin with Prozac and finally weined off of Prozac and the tremors subsided.,I took Prozac once a day in the morning with my other medications. At first my depression was under control but after about 5 years the depression began to become more intense. I was then placed on Wellbutrin with Prozac and my depression soon was improving. However; I started noticing hand shakes which progressively got worse. So after 2 years of Prozac and Wellbutrin I was told to stop Prozac. Within 6 months the shaking/tremors subsided and my depression is now fine by taking only Wellbutrin (150 mg/day)

I was far less concerned about things which had previously worried me and felt more enabled to engage in social activities again.,The drug was somewhat over stimulating leading to mild feelings of panic.

I suspected that I was not in the control group because of my dramatic results.  Following the study; we were each given a consultation with the physician who was overseeing the test.  He was the head of the Psychopharmacology Department at the University of Pennsylvania.  He explained to me how the drug worked and suggested that I stay on it for a while.  I remember he remarked how I walked the first few days of the test; and how different my demeanor became after the first week.  I stayed on the drug for close to two years; then weaned myself off.

patient,57,female,depression,pain,vicodin,Prozac (Fluoxetine) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,20 mg  taken one a day for the period of currently and for over a year,The combination of the two drugs helped me cope with my pain and depression; which seem to be related.  I'm able to cope with most of life's difficulties and am not sleeping as much.  With the vicodin helping with the pain; when I do sleep I find it's much more restful and satisfying.  I still have a long way to go and I believe that I will need to take these two drugs for a while as I tried quitting the prozac and immediately resumed the depression.,A little more sleepy and lack energy.  Also; it's obvious with the prozac that I'm at a point that I'm not able to go off of it without replacing it with something.  The vicodin doesn't seem to be a problem with side effects as long as I don't take more than one tablet at a time (500/5).,I've had depression and pain for some time.  They have both caused serious problems in my life.  I found myself isolated and sleeping far too much.  I did some research and found that lack of seritonin could cause an increse sensitivity to pain so I was hoping that my pain would subside with this treatment.  So far; I can't tell the difference.  My doctor seems to be concerned about taking the vicodin but I'm more concerned about the long term effects of the prozac.  Only time will tell.

My recovery from anorexia was not easy; so I had a few months of moderate bulimia. It was then that my dosage grew bigger: 3 pills of 20 mg per day; though some days I would have 4 pills. ,don't recall,it takes very long; and requires a very large amount of patience.

After about one month of taking this I began feeling much better. Although things still are not perfect; and I have very blue periods; it has at least made life tolerable. ,Reduced sex drive.  Had quite a normal sexual appetite before using this; and it has decreased dramatically. ,Began taking 20 mg daily then increased it to 40 after 3 months.  Might help more if I were to go to some type of counseling; which I have not.

I was never suicidal or violent,I had some sleep disturbancebut the worst was a 15 lb. weight gain that came off only after switching to another antidepressant,I took the prozac once daily and got regular exercize.

I had hoped to have the side effect of weight loss but didn't.  I didn't notice a reduction in libido as my husband did when he took Paxil.,I was depressed and had a lot of nightmares and prozac reduced both of these problems.  I have been taking the same dosage for nearly 20 years now.
patient,20,female,depression,none,none,Prozac (Fluoxetine) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,6,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,20mg  taken daily for the period of four months,Less depressed; I could consintrate on daily life better. I was happier; less anxious; stopped worrying so much.,I felt manic at times; surreal. I was thirsty a lot; and forgot to eat. ,I was suppose to take 20mg daily for treatment of depression; it helped my depression but i often felt manic and 'not myself'
patient,45,female,Depression,None,None,Prozac (Fluoxetine) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,1,Moderately Effective,Severe Side Effects,Not sure  (dosage frequency: 1 pill a day)  for the period of 6 months,There really weren't any - I didn't feel any better as the stressors in my life were still there.  I did not feel any relief from the depression; as a matter of fact; I felt worse.,I couldn't sleep at night and would fall asleep during the day.  It sometimes made me agitated too.,I really wasn't comfortable with taking Prozac in the first place - I had a crappy HMO doctor who thought giving me a pill would solve my problem.  I really just needed a change in my life (job; living in DC) to reverse my depression.  In other words; I think my depression was situational; not a chemical imbalance.  I know that these do work for many people; but I think it's imperative that a person know WHY they are depressed before they hit the pharmacy.

I was having a serious bout of depression when I first started taking Prozac; and the drug lifted the symptoms of extreme hopelessness and racing negative thoughts. I've tried to go off the medication but whenever I do; negative thoughts and the resulting emotions return. When I resume taking Prozac; the symptoms subside. The medicine allows me to challenge thoughts rather than react to them.,I have problems sleeping--not falling asleep but staying asleep. I sometimes feel nervous (that is; nervous energy; not anxiety). I'd also say that Prozac can make me feel numb; but it's better than being severely depressed. Overall; the side effects aren't bad enough for me to stop treatment or look for another medication.,I've been taking 40 mg. of Prozac once a day for about 20 years (I started taking it about the time it first became available.)

This is probably a drug that works for some people but didn't work at all for me in fact I felt much much worse. Unfortunately; I didn't review the contraindications. ,I got a rash on the back of my neck that lasted for 1 year even though I only took Prozac for 2 months. Also; I couldn't sleep as a result of taking Prozac. It seemed like after I stopped taking it I still had it in my body because I couldn't get rid of the rash on my neck and it was very annoying. Thhis is the first time that anything like this has ever happened to me.,i took it once a day for PMS

I feel like I am less anxious and more calm.  I feel that my moods are more even.  I don't know what the long term effects are of taking this medication; though; and worry that I may get a stomach ulcer since I take over the counter pain relievers.,none really; but I have noticed an increase in tiredness,I take one capsule in the morning; as prescribed by the doctor.

XR in the morning and 10 mg. in the afternoon before a hospitalization. I was switched to Prozac from the Imipramine; and given Trazadone to help sleep. I am also on an upward increase in dose of Strattera; because my A.D.D. has gotten very bad on the Prozac and off the Imipramine; but have a better mood and increased social ability.,Info,-

Now; 6 months after beginning treatment; my blood pressure has also fallen. With BP medication alone; my BP hovered around 135/85. Couple with Prozac; my blood pressure is consistantly in the 110-120 over 80-80 range. I also experience very little panic attacks ( I used to have several a day). When I do experience one; I have been able to self talk myself down from it. ,mild veryigo for 2-3 weeks,10 mg Prozac every morning

The cost is lower than other antidepressants which can be a help to those on a budget.,Sleepy and lack of response to problems.  Took too long to get started.  I think anyone else would think it wasn't effective and stop taking it.  ,took a seemingly long period of time to become effective.  Once started; however; it did what I expected.  It is hard to be without now and think that it will be a problem stopping in the future.

I would still feel bad somtimes; but it never again felt like true depresion.  It was like there was some "padding" between me and the bad feelings.,also had a very hard time withdrawing from it. I tried several times but fell into severe depression and had to start taking it again.  I thought I'd have to be on it for life.  However; once I managed to make it through a full week without it; I felt fine; and have never had to use it again.,I have a long history of depression but had never taken medication for it.  I asked my doctor to prescribe Prozac.  For the first week I felt the same; but I slept almost 24/7 and barely ate. After that I did get a significant relief from the depression.  Unfortunately; as I noted above; I don't like the way I acted during that time; and still cringe with embarassment and/or regret over things I said and did.  But at the time everything seemed so rosy; that none of my behavior bothered me.  Unfortunately; life is not perfect; and as adults we must take things seriously and deal with them.  Prozac kept me from acknowledging that.  Looking back; if I had faced my depression head on; and let it inspire me to make real changes in my life I would have been a lot better off in the long run.

It is so effective for my depression that I start feeling like I'm "cured" and don't need to take it any more. I have found that when I stop taking it; I'll be fine for a few days or weeks; and then I start feeling symptoms of depression again. For the last 3 years; I have taken it regularly and am not planning on stopping. It doesn't make me feel happy every day; because that's not its purpose; however it does keep me from entering a depressive state.,I have not felt any side effects. I know other people feel loss of libido; but I did not suffer this pre-menopause. I have lost some libido since menopause; which is what I attribute it to.,I take 20 mg every morning with my vitamins. For 2 years I took 40 mg every other day; however I haven't felt the need to do this anymore.

Most of the time; I have more patience than I did before taking the drug and can articulate my emotions better. ,Not too interested in sex anymore.,I take one Prozac 20 mg in the morning.

Also to note; patient showed a general improvement in social and educational functions as expressed in an academic report.,Increased insomnia with a decrease in appetite; as common with this medication.,The patient was asked to participate in active counseling in addition to the medication. Some of the compulsions appear to correlate to stress induced anxiety; so the patient was urged to stop; breathe; relax; before attempting a stressful (or habitual) activity.  I also found it necessary to inform the patient of the current paradigm on his condition as well as offer alternative treatments.
patient,23,female,Mild Depression and Anxiety,NA,NA,Prozac (Fluoxetine) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,5,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,10mg  taken once daily for the period of 3 weeks,So far; I have experienced an uplift in mood and a dulling of anxious reactions and PMS symptoms.  I can't say it's all due to the Prozac; as I'm employing CBT methods; but my anxiety has not escalated into a full blown attack and I generally feel a lot better about life and about myself.  I'm still weighing if these benefits are worth all of the symptoms I'm experiencing.  It's been hard to maintain a positive outlook when I don't feel normal due to the trembling and tremoring.    ,Immediately after beginning treatment I experienced heartburn and nausea that would come in waves all day long.  Due to this; I lost 6 pounds in a 3 week period (worrisome because I am a normal weight).  About a week and a half later the nausea started to subside; but then I noticed I was feeling very stimulated. It was as if I could actually feel energy rushing in my body; and had to keep moving or get up and do something with myself. Soon after this began; I started experiencing trembling and tremors/twitches in my hands; arms; legs; feet; and neck.  Generally the tremoring subsides when I am up and moving; (e.g. walking); but when I start to relax (e.g. sitting or lying down) I tend to feel it more.  At first there was a twitch here and there; but now it happens very frequently and all over.  No sexual side effects noted yet.    ,I was prescribed Prozac for managing mild depression and anxiety attacks in conjunction with weekly counseling and cognitive behavorial therapy methods.  when the trembling and tremoring began; I went back to the counseling center to ask about them.  The psychiatrist had said some people react to Prozac in that fashion and that the side effects wane in time.  I also read that stimulating effects such as those were actually fairly common in Prozac users.  I go back to MY Psychiatrist in two days to discuss the effectiveness of the pill; the side effects I'm experiencing; and whether or not we should continue.
patient,30,female,Depression,none,none,Prozac (Fluoxetine) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,10 mg  taken 1/day for the period of 1 year,Before taking Prozac I had no energy or joy - I could barely lift my head off the pillow in the morning. I just wanted to stay in bed. When I first started taking it; I could feel it physically - I felt a little "giddy" and my eyes felt/looked glazed. But over time; those feelings went away and I just felt normal. I no longer felt like I was on a drug - I just felt good. I could get up in the morning and looked forward to each day. ,I had very vivid dreams/nightmares the entire time I took it. Eight years later; I can still remember many of them and the way they made me feel. I gained weight (from 115lbs to 130lbs). ,I began by taking 5mg tablets one time a day for one week. The next week I increased to 10mg tablets on time/day. I took Prozac for one year. When I stopped taking it I reduced the dosage to 5mg tablets one time a day for about 2 weeks. I did not have any ill effects when I quit taking it.

I then went on a major shopping spree; had major increased energy and talked a lot more then I usually do.  By the second night; I started crying and could not stop and my teeth would not stop chattering.  Over the next few days I became like a zombie during the day; but by night I would be a crying shaking mess.  On the last day of taking this medication I was truly suicidal and I was not even depressed when I started this medication a week earlier.  This medication was to treat severe anxiety only; and it did help for this; but made me severely depressed as a consequence.  This medication may be very beneficial for some people; but it did not work for me.,I started taking one 10mg tablet of Fluoxetine in the morning for three days and then changed to one 20mg tablet in the morning

I noticed colours for the first time in years and I couldn't stop looking at the beautiful sky; grass and flowers. I felt alive; energetic; happy and positive; For the first time in years I wanted to get up in the mornings and LIVE. I wanted to go out in the world again; where as before I hid in my house because of panic attacks. I landscaped my whole garden and when that was done; I decided I wanted to work again and found a job. My marriage flourished after this new me and I fell pregnant 6 months later; at which time I had to discontinue; but that 6 months of Prozac was all it took to give me a new life.,would NOT recommend taking this with alcohol; especially something like tequila which is an upper. Combined with alcohol I experienced wild abandon; loss of inhibitions and total change in personality; I am usually quite reserved; but became quite the opposite - which sorted the libido out; but still unable to climax.,My treatment involved psychotherapy as well as the medication.

Once off the Prozac my depression was worsen made me realise that the treatment was working but that I had not realised this.I restarted my treatment shortly after and felt much better. Although I felt better I realised that Prozac by itself was not the answer and I had to address other areas in my life.,There was no negative side effects.,Within the first eight months I did not notice any benefits and decided to stop the treatments. Once off the Prozac my depression was worsen made me realise that the treatment was working but that I had not realised this.I restarted my treatment shortly after and felt much better.

The effects totally calmed me; enabling me to resume my 'normal' life.  I regained my weight and although not totally free from the fluoxetine; have now cut down to every other day and have now been able to resume working.  My experience is that the fluoxetine have taken away the extreme mood swings.,No side effects as such.  However; the negative from my point of view is that there is an almost unreal calmness and lack of feeling/excitement/or even anger.........however as it is my intention to only use the fluoxetine for what is a relatively short term period; I beleive that this has been a 'symptom' worth experiencing.,20 mg once a day.

The Trazadone helps me sleep inspite of the Prozac.  I no longer have any manic phases thanks to Lamictal.,None,I started with the Prozac.  Then the trazadone was added to help me sleep.  I was always cycling into manic phases but they became more extreme and serious.  The Lamictal completely obliterated the mania.  I feel completely stable; happy and am very high functioning.

I am able to focus on tasks better and can accomplish more each day. Mood swings; irritability; and temper outbursts are rare. I have gone from below-average to above-average coping skills. Feelings of worthlessness and suicidal thoughts no longer occur. ,Increased thirst and decreased libido.,Before Prozac; for many years I was unable to experience sustained happiness or control my mood. I was irritable at least 10 days each month; had uncontrollable racing thoughts; experienced frequent temper outbursts; felt hopeless and worthless; did not view life as worthwhile; thought about suicide often and made several attempts. There was no joy in my life and I suffered from delibitating migraine headaches 5 or 6 times per year. When I went to the doctor; I was unable to stop thinking about suicide. My doctor put me on Prozac; 20 mg each a.m. and I improved dramatically in a few weeks. After 6 months; I felt like I was slipping back a little; so the doctor increased my dose to 40 mg each morning. As long as I take the Prozac; I am happy and stable and have maybe one migraine a year. About once a year I try to reduce the Prozac to 20 mg; but within 1 week symptoms begin to recur so I resume 40 mg daily.

My depression had somewhat subsided and my panic attacks were less severe; albeit not completely gone. ,From my personal experience; this drug exerts its effects mainly through a total numbing of one`s emotions. I had become a zombie; not feeling depressed but at the same time not feeling any positive emotions. My emotions had been totally flattened. My libido was gone.

Maybe just a bit more insomnia but I had that before taking Zoloft.,I went to my internist and told him that I wanted to be put on a low dose of an antidepressant and something for my anxiety . I had been on Effexor for many years; awile ago. Effexor worked but the withdrawal symptoms were horrible; even if I so much as missed a dose. Perhaps it was a placebo effect; but I felt the Zoloft working after about a week. Nothing earth shattering;but noticeable.

It made me realize how down I was.  I've heard other people say the same thing about feeling "normal."  I would still get down but it wouldn't last for days.  I could get through it like a healthy-minded person.  It was such a relief from what I had been feeling.  I told myself that I would take it forever if I had to......anything to not feel what I had been feeling for years:  depressed that I'm not good enough.,In the past few years I've tried to get off of it by reducing my dose.  I cut my pills in half (to 50 mg) and after a few weeks went through a depression that REALLY sucked.  But I got through it.  When I tried to take it down to 25 mg; I got really depressed again and it wouldn't go away.  I went back up to 50mg and am still there.,I've forgotten a day or have run out of a prescription and didn't get it refilled for a few days.  I got a bit light headed.  Definitely not something you can quit cold turkey.

So many problems would have been solved for me. I was never happy; cryed often and had no self worth at all.  I was also very anxious and uncomfortable around people and avoided many social situations because of this.  In short I was not enjoying anything at all about life or work!  When I started taking Zoloft (under my doctor' care) it was like a miracle for me.  I went back to school!  I pursued a new career (my old job was nothing other than a hiding place for me) I blossomed!  I honestly do not know if this drug has the same effect on everyone but I recommend trying it. I should be the poster child for Zoloft.  I am still taking it and may be for the rest of my life.  As for people who complain about anti-depressants; there is only one thing to say to them; They obviously have never known the debilitating effects of depression! ,No libido,I started taking 50 mg. of Zoloft for about a month while my doctor monitored me.  And then he gradually increased the dosage.

She is dyslexic too.  She was put on Zoloft to help control her anxiety and panic attacks.  I think it helped; however she became numb to a lot of social norms.  She never did anything terrible; but I always felt that she would do something inappropriate.  We d/c her Zoloft at the beginning of the summer of 2007.  We weaned her off per the dr's instructions.  She is much more normal now.  Minor anxiety and a lot more normal as far as social skills and obeying social norms.

I felt more normal shortly after starting treatment. ,I apparently didn't have any side effects; at least not any listed on the drug information. However; after a period of a couple months; I became completely turned off by sex. After a longer period; I got freaked out by the idea; not good for a married woman. Still I didn't associate it with Zoloft. I spoke with a friend who had taken Zoloft as well; and she stated that she was 'running' from her husband regarding sex and changed meds. I also requested a change to another anti-depressant and no longer have a libido problem.,I was suffering from clinical depression that manifested itself as overall crankiness; irritability and sore; aching muscles in my shoulders and neck. My doctor prescribed muscle relaxers and x-rayed my neck. No problems. I went to a psychiatrist who diagnosed depression. I was given Zoloft and the irritability and muscle aches went away very quickly.

Less moodiness.,Weight gain; extreme tiredness during the day; insomnia at night; bad effect on libido and sexual ability. Extreme lethargy.,first cut the dose down to 50 mgs. and did not experience problems. I then slowly titrated down over several months until I came off of it completely. Over the next few weeks; I started experiencing strange; tingling sensations down my body; panic attacks; (which I had never experienced before); and extreme nausea - which became so bad; I lost 20 pounds in 6 weeks. This was all extremely traumatic as I am a type 1 diabetic who needs to eat to balance the insulin I take. The panic attacks got so bad; I had to be on Xanax XR everyday for months. I could not function normally or work. I tried to stick it out because I didn't want to go back on an SSRI after all the trouble and side effects it caused. I went to a MD who was also an alternative care specialist; thinking he could give me St. Johns Wort and I could manage with that until I got over the physical side effects of the SSRI; but it didn't work. I eventually had to go back on an SSRI just to function normally. I am on Lexapro now. I managed to be drug free for the first 40 years of my life (except for insulin); and now because of the aftermath of Zoloft; I am on Ambien; Lexapro; and Valium occasionally for anxiety. To top that off; the alternative doctor put me on a supplement that ended up being an anabolic steroid (which he called a 'nutritional supplement' and I ended up having to go on even more medication to fight the side effects that I incurred from that. All because of Zoloft. I will regret taking it the rest of my life.

If I do not take the Zoloft when I get up (later in the day) I get headachs.  No other side effects.,Initial dosage was 50 mg gradually over two year my span dosage increased to 200 mg.  I still am taking Zoloft.  I am somewhat fraid my symptoms will resurface.  I am also concerned about any withdrawals or headachs.

I can speak on the telephone to people; be in person around people I've never met; and function in society in general. This doesn't sound like a big feat; but I had crippling anxiety and it's a giant step for me. ,The first week of my treatment; I had horrible leg cramps and nausea. I actually had to hold a vomit bag while I sat on the couch; and car rides were pretty impossible from motion sickness. But that passed pretty quickly. ,I began on 50mg; after growing absolutely sick of feeling terrible all the time. I went on this for about six months; with little difference in my moods. After a suicide attempt (overdose on Trazodone; I no longer take this medication); I was put into a psychiatric ward for a week and my dosage was doubled from 50mg to 100mg; which was one of the best things to ever happen to me. I am now very stable after a year on the 100mg and couldn't be happier.

I was just taking whichever pills the doctors set out for me; and when i left the hospital i just continued taking zoloft; because i knew i was going to be depressed. I continued taking it for about a year and a half after leaving the hospital but eventually wanted to try living with a clear mind. When I stopped the dosage gradually (as one is well advised) I went on living ok; but was still depressed. I was looking for something to take my mind off the recovery; so of course i dabbled in alcohol and the occasional marijuana use; but I eventually went on to realize that i didn't need any drugs at all. There is something to be said for a natural high; but i decided to put myself back on the lowest dose of zoloft in hopes of clearing my mind so that i could go back to school without the depression hampering my focus.

I wish I could keep on taking them indefinitely as I am in a life situation which can't be readily changed in the foreseeable future; where I am unhappy and stressed; which can and does lead to depression and negative; sometimes suicidal; thoughts. I found Sertraline completely ineffective for my IBS.,After taking drug for 4 months I developed (for want of a better description) 'muscle jumps' (more severe than twitches and different from tics) which could occur in any part of my body; causing a literal 'jump' in the affected body part!  These only occurred when I lay down - usually when I was in bed; but didn't occur when I was up and about moving around.,I gave up taking Sertraline completely on my own volition as the condition was getting worse and although more irritating than serious; it started to interfere with my sleep.  The condition took around 2 months to completely disappear.

I am a classic type A person and tend toward anxiety when I have alot going on in my personal and professional life.  I asked my physician about Zoloft when my second child was 2 years old and I was under alot of stress at work.  I sleep much better; am more even tempered; and more optimistic when taking Zoloft.  Another benefit; probably due to my anxiety being under control; is that I think more clearly.  I don't become distracted as easily and find it easier to stay focused on projects at work.  ,I need to take my dose with breakfast.  If not; I feel nauseous.  This hasn't been a huge issue; since I eat breakfast regularly.  However; if I take a pill and eat immediately; I feel sick to my stomach.  The only other issue I have had is that I feel dizzy if I miss a dose.  I am good at remembering to take my morning dose; so this does not happen often.   Also; I did go off Zoloft a couple of years ago because I wanted to reduce the number of drugs I was taking.  Although I gradually reduced my dosage; I had a difficult time when I finally went completely off.  I felt dizzy and suffered a couple of bouts of vertigo.  ,I take 75 mg in the morning.  Zoloft was prescribed to me by a family practice physician when I was 41 years old. The first 18 months that I took Zoloft; my dosage was 100 mg.  I took a break for about 2 years and asked my physician abbout going back on Zoloft last year; when I turned 45.  I was experiencing mood swings right before my period and; in doing research on the internet; learned that this could be due to my age.  One recommendation was treating the symptoms with zoloft or another prescription drug.  My physcian started me on 50 mg; and I went up to 75 mg after a few months of taking Zoloft.

This helped to take the edge off so that I could function without the extreme mood swings.,I didn't notice any side effects except that it seemed to mess with weight loss.  Going off the medication for the periods indicated by my dr seemed to help.,I was advised to take the medication daily for the week leading to my period starting.  My dr said that through trial and error I would find the best treatment plan.  Turns out I usually take it everyday except for the first day of my period and 3 - 5 days after that.  I was also advised to take 20 minute daily walk in the sun.

My partner noticed it immediately and I noitced it in myself. I havn't cried at all and  although I don't feel depressed it's more that all my feelings have been numbed! I feel that nothing affects me and that I am better able to cope day to day.,The main effects have been the chronic fatigue. Although I sleep fantastically each night I wake exhausted and spend the rest of the day feeling like I have a hang over. I have no energy all day and find that I don't want to do anything all day although I do wonder whether that is through no energy or motivation! Feeling so fatigued also makes you so low and depressed so thats no help in the long run.Also my libido completely disappeared especially in the early days although it is not fantastic now. ,Although this has been by far the best treatment drug I have tried in terms of treating my depression and mood swings and irritability at the moment I have chosen to withdraw from the drug due to the chronic fatigue which was bringing me down and beginning to make me low in another way. I have been told by the professionals that I have a chemical inbalance and that I have to take the anti-depressants like a diabetic has to take their insulin but for the moment I have chosen to have a moment drug free to find out what sort of person I am! I suspect I will last only a few weeks. Of of all the drugs I have tried this has been by far been the most successful for me in treating the symptoms.

After I was on Zoloft for a couple of weeks I noticed a substantial difference. I no longer felt the "looming dread" that comes with a panic attack and I just felt calmer and more in control than before. I was finally able to get my life back and felt more at ease.,I went off of Zoloft on my own in October of 2008. I went down gradually from 50mg to 25 for about a week and then went off completely. The two weeks afterward were a bit crazy. The panic attacks didn't come back but I'd get all emotional at the slightest upset and feel like crying for no reason (which isn't me at all). I also had the strangest; most vivid dreams. I recently went back on the drug after the panic attacks came back and apart from slight dizzyness and diarrhea I'm starting to feel more in control again and less panicky.,My family doctor prescribed it for panic attacks. I saw a psychiatrist years ago but it really didn't do much apart from giving me tips on what to do constructively if I have a panic attack. Which of course didn't help because when you're paralyzed with fear you can't do much of ANYTHING constructive with your time.

I use to feel like I could crawl out of my skin two weeks before my period after starting zoloft I notice a considerable difference.I also felt anxious and restless which has subsided with the use of the zoloft. ,I did not seem to be subjected to any side effect. I was concerned about weight gain; fatigue and uncontrolled hunger but I did not have any of these side effects.,First you must be diagnosed with either anxiety or mild to moderate depression. You begin at a lower does to see how you manage with that then eventually if need be your perscriber can increase the dose. Their is no special time of the day to take it and you do not have to eat with it. The most important thing is it does not alter how you feel through out the day you do not get a sensation of being high or druged. There is no lasting effect; if you stop the drug it is out of your system the next day.

It took approximately 2 weeks to see results but after that time it was a noticable difference.,The main side effect is dizziness.  For example just sitting and then the room begins to spin.  This only began to happen when I started the medication.  Also I would not advise stopping the medication all of a sudden.  When this happened I began to have terrible headaches; became very dizzy and moody even more so than when I began the medication.  ,The plan for this treatment was to decrease the frequency and intensity of anxiety attacks.  Medication combined with counseling has helped improve the situation.  When I went off the medication it was only for a short period of time and then I realized it was necessary to go back onto the medication because of the benefits.

Where other medications had not worked; or had adverse side effects; Wellbutrin did not. This after several years of trial and error with other anti-depressants.,No acute side effects were experienced.,Extreme depression over a period of 12 years; seemingly untreatable. Multiple medication combinations were tried via trial and error. These included Zyprexa; Effexor (induced mild mania over time); Paxil; Prozac; and others.

It also reduced my appetite for everything; including food.  Therefore; at first; I did manage to stop smoking WITHOUT gaining weight or being depressed about giving up the cigerates.  It just didn't seem important.,After a while; I began to notice that NOTHING seemed important to me.  I also seemed to be moving in a world that had slowed down considerably.  That may sound good; at first; but the reality was that the only thing that had slowed down was ME--the rest of the world kept going as usual.  I began to notice that I couldn't seem to develop a sense of urgency even when it was IMPORTANT to do so because I had lost my sense of "timing."  I tended to be late everywhere I went; I couldn't complete assignments on time; and my sleeping time increased dramatically.,I was taking the Bupropion as an aide to break my smoking habit.  I was also using prescription nicotene patches in decreasing amounts.  The treatment WAS effective in TEMPORARILY breaking the smoking habit and possibly could have had longer lasting effects; however; my skin had a reaction to the patches (I started developing large; red; hot circles everywhere they touched my skin) and I found that I could not effectively lead my day-to-day life while under the influence of the Bupropion. Once I stopped using both products; I slowly returned to smoking.

So Istarted on paxal for 3 months .felt somewhat better but slowed down or groggy.I decided the side effects were counter productive to what I needed in an antidepressant. Iasked to try wellbutrin. And felt the above mentioned benefits. I stared on the extended release then switched to generic and 2x a day dosing as the generic was much cheaper.I felt no difference between name brand and generic. Ihad no weight loss side effect.

In addition to the Bi-Polar disorder I have lived with most of my life. The post-partum is very scary.I knew before my 3rd child was born what I would be in for;so I was ready this time and armed with Wellbutrin.It is definitely not a cure-all; more like a bandaid;but the bandaid helped get us through the last 8 months;while being more able to work on the root of the problems through counseling.

patient,53,female,depression,menopause,climara,Wellbutrin (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,450 mg  taken 1 daily for the period of 3 years,I have taken antidepressants for many years; and this is first that did not "flip the switch" on sexuality.  I no longer feel like I am looking out of a dark room.  I have more energy; feel more motivated; and overall function at a higher level than before.,A little bit of "hyper" feelings.  I take the entire dose at one time; daily; and have been advised that the feeling of being revved up would disspiate if I did take it in two or more doses during the day.  I try to minimize the effect by taking the medication first thing in the morning.,I suffer chronic depression and the Wellbutrin is the first antidepressant that did not sedate me; and the only that did not dampen sexual feelings.  I have taken tricyclics (sp?) which were extremely sedating as well as limiting as far as OTC medications and dietary restrictions.  I have also tried SSRIs (prozac; zoloft; etc.)and while they temporarily relieved my depression; 1) the effect did not last more than 6 months; and 2) they completely destroyed my libido.

Aggression was significant. I became very quick tempered; which in uncharacteristic for my personality type. Libido was not improved.,I have a "slow" brain. Specifically I have what soem researchers refer to as "sluggish cognitive tempo". Taking a drug that has some dopaminergic activity could theoretically improve certain parts of the symptomology.
patient,33,female,depression,none,none,Wellbutrin (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,5,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,400 mg/ day  taken twice/ day for the period of 4 years,I have a long history in taking anti-depressant drugs.  It started in high school with prozac and desipramine; neither of which I have anything positive to report.  In college; after a dangerous stint without treatment; it resumed with luvox; and  later it was effexor.  Finally; after the scariest bout of all; leading to a stay in the hospital; they put me on wellbutrin.  Combined with rigorous therapy; dbt (dialectical behavioral therapy) groups; and much personal work; I got my head above water.  I was able to work; eat well and exercise regularly; but many of the symptoms were still there.  I thought that was the extent of what an anti-depressant could do for me; the rest of the work was up to me and maybe in about 20 years I might be able to feel happiness.  Since then I went off wellbutrin during a cross-country move; was part of a study for treatment resistant depression where it was recommended I try cymbalta.  I feel the cymbalta has actually influenced my negative thinking and given me more energy.  So now I know that an anti-depressant can potentially create better results than just keeping ones head above water.  ,None of the previous meds I mentioned; however did a damn thing but cause me to shake; be continuously thirsty and not be able to achieve orgasm.  The wellbutrin was great in that it didn't cause any sexual side effects.  That was a relief.  The ability to reach orgasm seems as if it should me a basic right for every human being; and the emptiness that replaces the disappearance of the bodies biological ability to feel good; just doesn't seem right.  I was very adament in telling my psychiatrist that I didn't want anything that caused sexual side effects; which most anti-depressants do.  The cymbalta causes the "emptiness"  but honestly; the improvement it has made in my mood and productivity make it worth it for now.  Plus; I'm not in a meaningfully intimate relationship at the moment.  It seems to only cause and inability to reach inner orgasm however.  Clitoral orgasm is still possible with vibrator and not a human being.   Recently they have added a dose of wellbutrin to my regimen as an attempt to counteract the sexual side effect caused by the cymbalta.  I do not yet know if this is working (Like I said; I have no boyfriend so I don't even know why I'm bothering.  Really I did it to see if the addition of wellbutrin would make me feel even better.  I haven't felt much difference.,Once a month I see a psychiatrist; although I am "in between" doctors right now because my previous one left as they always seem to do.  I have been without a therapist for a while now; wanting to take a break from the time and monetary commitment  that therapy demands.  I am  beginning to think that now is a good time to go back to it.  I consider the jogging; yoga; healthy eating and vitamins I take to be a part of my treatment.

It worked very well for me; even though I tried almost all the SSRIs over the years.,Dry mouth became a problem after years of use. No other side effects were a problem. There was decreased appetite as well; which I consider to be a benefit.,I took the drug for many years before it became a problem and I had to stop. I'm not sure what you want me to describe here.
patient,39,female,depression,none,none,Wellbutrin (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,300 mg  taken daily for the period of 1 year,The drug worked on reducing/eliminating my situational feelings of depression.  Initially; it increased my energy and focus; and stopped the feelings of sadness.  It did not make me feel like a "zombie" and I felt connected to my emotions and the people around me; which I had heard was a side effect of other anti-depressants.,At first I had crazy dreams; whch wasn't so bad.  I did not have any trouble falling asleep.  I had very high energy for the first 2 weeks; then it tapered off back to normal.  I wish the energy had remained.  I did not lose any weight; which I was hoping for...but I did not gain any either; so that was positive.,I started on 150 mg for 2 weeks on the brand name drug once a day.  It seemed like as soon as I was switched to the generic 300mg; the energy and focus benefits stopped.  There is no way to know if it was the switch to generic or just my body getting used to the drug; but it was dissapointing.  I really enjoyed the energy.  I weaned myself off after 1 year because I didn't need it anymore.  I did not have any significant withdrawal symptoms.  Overall it was a positive experience; although I was glad to not need it anymore.

I initially started taking Wellbutrin because it was tauted as having little to no sexual side effects. I really was highly disappointed in the overall experience of this drug. I immediately switched back to Effexor. ,After a couple of days of taking the drug; I started experiencing severe flash anger. The smallest nuisance would set me off. I remember actually throwing something across my dining room. It was awful. At that point I decided to no longer take the drug. ,I am not certain what I should describe here. The treatment details were that I was prescribed a medication after having asked for it due to its advertised benefits and I never have been so disappointed in a medicine until this one. I am not certain if other people have had similar experiences or not; but it wasn't pleasant.

patient,30,female,depression,none,multi-vitamin; omega fatty acid supplement,Wellbutrin (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,2,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,50 or 100mg?  taken once per day for the period of 4 months,none,irritability and extreme anxiety; mild panic attack,I have been on Zoloft with great results for over 5 years. I do not have a constant barrage of depressed thoughts or emotions when I am on the drug.  When my husband and I decided to try to have a baby; my ob-gyn suggested that I switch to Wellbutrin.  Some anti-depressants may carry a small risk of side-effects to the baby in the 3rd trimester of pregnancy.  My ob-gyn felt that taking Wellbutrin may reduce these risks.   After 1 or 2 months on Wellbutrin; I began to feel very irrtable and anxious.  My chest began to tighten painfully with even the thought of something stressful.  After 4 months on Wellbutrin; I had my first panic attack ever.  I threw the pills in the trash and went to see a psychiatrist.  The psychiatrist told me that there was no medically proven benefit to switching to Wellbutrin; and put me back on Zoloft.  I feel much better!

I was able to taper off the medication--NEVER quit abruptly--and have been doing fine. I began running to help with the depression and IBS and; in my opinion; it works very well. I still have times of irritability; but that's normal life; right?
patient,39,female,depression,none,none,Wellbutrin (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,100 mg  taken daily for the period of several years,My dosage is NOT the standard treatment of 300 mg daily; however at the 100 mg daily dose I get some benefits; including decreased irritability and appetite control; without side effects. ,None.,I have been on this medication; at this dosage for a few years now; and it works great. No side effects at the 100 mg per day dose but I still get the benefits of help with mood swings and appetite control.

There really wasn't anything more to it; but I gather I have to write 50 words; so here they are. ,None. ,I'm not sure I understand the question. This was pretty simple - I had a tendency to slip into deep depressions without medication. The drugs prevented that without side effects.

I will stop taking the medication.,I've been taking Duloxetina (Cymbalta) 60mg for 2 years now. It helps with my mood but it doesn't take all the depression sympthoms away.
patient,30,female,depression,mood swings,none,Wellbutrin (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,300 mg  taken once per day for the period of 3 years,Lifting of mood.,No noticeable side-effects from the brand name; problems with generic.  Details in next section.,I began taking Wellbutrin about 3 years ago.  At some point; I realized the generic was available and switched to it.  I did not anticipate any difference in effectiveness or side effects as I thought the generic was chemically identical to the brand; minus the ink used to print "Wellbutrin" on the pills.  It took about a month before I thought switching to the generic might even be related to the onset of irritability and subjective experience of "heart pounding."  I switched back to the name brand and the negative side effects disappeared almost immediately.  Also during the period of irritability (and pulse increase; I think; but I didn't actually take my pulse); I had a blood vessel burst in my hand.  This was not a surface capillary; but a deep vessel; that caused a bruise to appear on both sides of my hand.  The bursting was not associated with any trauma to the hand; but seemed rather spontaneous.

I feel nearly back to normal emotionally.  I was concerned that it made my hands quite shaky for awhile; but after a reduced my caffeine intake; that subsided.  My only complaint is that it makes my ears ring.  All the time.  It is generally easy to ignore during the day; but I have found that I need a fan and a white noise machine set to a high pitch sound (like crickets) in order to be able to ignore it enough to sleep.,only complaint is that it makes my ears ring.  All the time.  It is generally easy to ignore during the day; but I have found that I need a fan and a white noise machine set to a high pitch sound (like crickets) in order to be able to ignore it enough to sleep.,Started out on one extended release tablet at 150 mg once per day.  After 4 weeks bumped up to 300 mg dose.

I also noticed that I had an easier time quitting smoking. I could be around smokers and not feel an urge to smoke; which had never happened in previous attempts to quit and using a nicotine patch.,During the first month I had insomnia. I slept about 3 hrs per night; however; I didn't feel fatigued by it. I also lost about 20 lbs in the first 6 months.,My doctor prescribed Wellbutrin for depression and anxiety. I take 150mg two times per day.

Well; it did absolulte nothing to help in that area and instead made me more depressed; irritable; had severe rages; crying all the time; no desire to get out of bed; hot flashes and my blood pressure spiked tremendously.   I went back to my PCP and I'm back to Zoloft which I had taken in the past and although I'm still having w/d's from the Wellbutrin; I'm felling 80% better in it's only been 3 days.   I tossed all the remaining pills out.    This drug clearly didn't work for my body.   What a horrible experience to go through.    I will in the future only get these types of meds from my PCP and not my OBGYN.

After 1 week in the psych ward; I was prescribed 2 medications that I soon realized didn't help.  Over the course of 1 year; I tried many different combinations of anti-depresants which didn't work.  Not until I tried both wellbutrin and topomax together did I start recovering from my breakdown.  About 1 1/2 years ago I discontinued the Topomax and I've only used the Wellbutrin since it helps me maintain my health. ,I didn't experience any side effects.,See above as that thoroughly explains everything.

Prozac made me suicidally depressed. MAO-Inhibitors like Parnate worked very well for me; except all of my favorite foods were forbidden.  Wellbutrin seemed to be the only antidepressant that lifted me out of my depression; and it had the unanticipated benefit of getting me to quit smoking -- I went from smoking a pack of Camels a day to not smoking.    ,I often would get pounding headaches; in the front of my skull and at the sides; especially as the day wore on.  I also would feel sick to my stomach early in the day; which would be exacerbated by coffee.  I got tremors. Occasionally I'd get migaines.  ,I took 2 100 mg of the Wellbutrin; 20mg of Ritalin and a 10 mg of a beta blocker (I can't remember the name) in the morning.  Then at 3 I took the other 200 mg of the Wellbutrin; at night I took the Serzone (before it was yanked from the market) and the Trazodone.  I took a drug holiday from the Ritalin over the weekend; but over the years I eventually increased the dosage to 35mg of Ritalin in the morning.
patient,27,female,Stop Smoking/Depression,N/A,Lexapro,Wellbutrin (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,6,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,150 mg   taken 1 x a day for the period of 3 days,So far it's only been 3 days.  Wellbutrin seems to give me a spike of energy which is nice.  Still have the craving for cigs so I'm continuing to smoke like I usually do.,Sometimes I lash out for no reason at all.  With Lexapro I remember having to wait a few weeks to get results; so I'm sure I'll wait.,Doc says to wait; that's the treatment.  I'm hoping like many this treatement will help me stop smoking and ease my depression.  You have to change your life and make yourself a better person; not just rely on drugs to cure you.  So; I'm working on the little things in life to change.  
patient,46,female,depression,none,none,Wellbutrin (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Psychotherapeutic-Agents,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,300 mg  taken once daily for the period of 6 months,I started with a 150 mg dose and that did next to nothing. I recently increased to 300 mg and then I really started to feel better. I felt kind of hyper and for the first time in ages was able to go back to my gym routine. I noticed a decrease in appetite which in my case is great as I have about 20 lbs to lose. This drug definitely helped with my feelings of worthlessness and failure and with the crying spells.,The worst side effect for me is stomach upset and trips to the bathroom; especially in the morning after I've taken it. The feeling of being all cranked up is good when I have so much to do (others say this wears off) but it also makes me feel a bit anxious and unable to relax. I had mild sleep problems; mainly early waking.,I'm really loving the increase in energy and the lifting of the black cloud; but sometimes I feel a little spinny. Since increasing the doseage I've noticed I've been doing more stupid things than normal; like almost backing up into a truck that I knew was there!!??

My mood brightened; I stopped feeling grief and self-loathing; began to remember what I liked to do. I also had increased ability to concentrate; increased energy; increased sex drive.   I was no longer depressed.  I stopped taking the medication after a couple of years; and the symptoms of depression did not return. ,I actually felt pretty upset during the first couple of weeks - shaky; a little manic and sensitive.  That did go away; though.  I also had occasional insomnia throughout. ,I met with my physician four weeks after I began taking the medication; then 3 months later; then every six months. I did not attend talk therapy or receive any other treatment.

It also had a midly energizing effect.,Very occassionally a racing feeling if I took the two doses too close together.,I've used wellbutrin in combination with other anti-depressants; but it is usually the other one (Zoloft; Prozac; Effexor) that loses it's effect after time. Wellbutrin has remained consistently reliable and contributes to the livlier aspects of mood elevation for me.

I was able to sleep better and deal with anxiety and stress better.,dry mouth was the worst side effect but since I should drink more water anyway it was a mixed blessing.,Effexor and Wellbutrin kept my depression under control - I took more during the winter months and less the rest of the year.

I am still currently taking the generic form of Wellbutrin SR (Bupropion). ,I took Wellbetrin XL for a little while; but I didn't like it because I felt like my emotions were on a rollercoaster ride. I went back to the generic form of Wellbutrin SR and I felt better; I would like to try the name brand of Wellbutrin since I have heard that it is actually better than the generic.I don't recall any bad side effects;except a little dry mouth.,I take 1 tablet in the morning an 1 tablet at night everyday.

I experienced a full blown anxiety attack on day 10; with racing thoughts that I could not control; suicidal thoughts; and a feeling that I was about to lose my mind. I had the presence of mind to realise that I was experiencing a reaction to the drug; but had to call a friend to spend the evening with me as I was experiencing a strong urge to kill myself. I discontinued the tablets; and the symptoms went away immediately
patient,38,female,Smoking Cessation,None,Birth Control,Zyban (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Smoking-Cessation,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,150mg  taken twice daily for the period of 4 Months,The drug did exactly what it was supposed to do.  It completely eliminated all nicotine cravings leaving only the psychological aspect to worry about.  So if I kept myself busy; the thought of smoking would never even enter my mind.,For the first week or so; I was slightly hyperactive and had some trouble sleeping.  That problem went away with some adjustment in the time I took the drug as well as with my bodies assimilation of the drug.  I also had a mildly bad taste in my mouth.  That too faded away.,I expressed to my doctor a desire to try this drug to quit smoking.  She prescribed it to me and I began taking it shortly thereafter.  Before my 2 week quit date had even arrived; I noticed a marked decrease in nicotine withdrawl episodes.  I just didn't need to smoke.  I found I was started to smoke only when I thought I "should" - after dinner; right before bed and other habitual times.  Once I stopped smoking all together; it was a relief to only have to battle my habits and not the withdrawl effects of nicotine as well.
patient,40,female,smoking cessation,none,none,Zyban (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Smoking-Cessation,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,2 tablets each day  taken twice daily for the period of 3 months,assisted with stopping smoking,vivid dreams; dry mouth,2 tablets each day - for 2 weeks continue smoking and then stop after 2 weeks. I don't know how this works but I really did not like smoking when taking this. The treatment still requires a fairly high degree of willpower to manage the cravings. I keep a checklist of things to do - brush my teeth; drink water; go for a walk. I have now been smoke free for 6 months and at times it's still hard - I do still get cravings but they don't last very long and I can control them. Another good tip I got was to put some butts in a jar with some water. A quick sniff of this and the thought of smoking goes away.
patient,49,female,to stop smoking,none,none,Zyban (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Smoking-Cessation,2,Considerably Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,unsure  (dosage frequency: once a day)  for the period of 3 weeks,It was the first product I ever tried that actually stopped my desire to quit smoking. Unfortunately due to the severe allergic reaction I had I was no longer able to take it.,I had a severe allergic reaction. It included hive; swelling and internalized into the joints. I had to take steroids to alleviate the reaction,I took the Zyban for three weeks and it helped me to quit smoking; but the side effects/allergic reaction was to severe to continue.
patient,49,female,to quit smoking,none,none,Zyban (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Smoking-Cessation,2,Considerably Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,don't remember  (dosage frequency: once a day)  for the period of 3 weeks,After taking the Zyban for 3 weeks my desire to smoke was nearly eliminated. I had tried other methods to quit smoking and this one actually worked! Unfortunately I had a severe allergic reactions to the medication (the main ingredient Wellbutrin).,I initially broke out in hives which became so severe I was taken off the Zyban and prescribed a steroid. The allergic reaction internalized and I ended up missing 3 weeks of work do the joint immobility it caused.,I was impressed with the ability the medication had with my decreased desire to want to smoke; but the side affects/allergic reaction was to severe to continue using it. 
patient,36,female,SMOKING CESSATION,none,none,Zyban (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Smoking-Cessation,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,150mg/d   taken 1xp/d. did not sustain recommended 300mg for the period of approx. 3 months/ 90 days,The treatment seemed to help considerably with the generalized brain 'fuzziness'; lack of focus; fatigue and irrational mood swings that I had experienced on every other non-Zyban supported attempt to quit smoking. The treatment dramatically lessened the effect of nicotine withdrawal; or at least its perception; such that any reflexive craving to smoke was manageably overcome until the habit was finally broken. ,At 150mg/d side effects were minimal - perhaps a slight boost in energy. In contrast; at 300mg/d - which I could handle for only a short period - I felt "shaky" with restless legs and some insomnia. These problems went away when I reverted to 150mg/d. I feel the treatment was entirely effective at this lower dose; and unmanageably unpleasant at the higher [and recommended!] dose. Perhaps Zyban should revisit their dosing recommendations.,I began taking 150mg/d two weeks/ 14 days before my actual quit date. On the quit date; I also started a series of yoga classes and regular physical activity through the first few months of smoking cessation. I decided to continue taking Zyban beyond the recommended period to a full 3 months at 1 dose daily. In my experience; I would recommend a lower daily dosage of 150mg/d for a longer extended period of time given my success in using Zyban in this manner.
patient,43,female,Smoking,none,none,Zyban (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Smoking-Cessation,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1 tablet per day  taken daily for the period of 10 weeks,I gave up smoking fo four months after taking Zyban for 10 weeks,Zyban made me not care about smoking; it also made me not care about anything else; not exactly depressed - just nothing seemed worthwhle.,I took Zyban for 10 days before my quit day; then quit smoking and continued with the Zyban for a further 8 weeks. During that time I smoked on three or four occasions; mostly part of my husband's cigarette. I was really pleased with how I had done; and thought I had finally managed to kick the habit. But on holiday with a lot of smokers I gave in and smoked; thinking I would stop again when I got home - unfortunately that didn't happen.

After about a week or two these side effects diminished or disappeared completely,Welbutrin was prescribed to aid in reducing or eliminating the urge to smoke. For the first two weeks smoke as normal and then at the conclusion of two weeks stop smoking altogether. After the first week the urge to smoke had been reduced and I found myself smoking less and less. By the end of week two the urge to smoke was minimal to non-existent.

patient,45,female,Smoking,None,None,Zyban (Bupropion) ,Antidepressants Smoking-Cessation,9,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,150mg  taken twice a day for first 6 weeks for the period of 10 weeks,I stopped smoking after one week of starting the treatment. I never picked up another cigarette. The cravings for the sensation of smoking; as well as the craving for nicotine were short and sharp; and lessened within a short period of time. I was able to sit with another smoker and not smoke ( or want to smoke) within one and a half weeks of stopping. Incidently I lost 4 - 5 Kgs within 4 weeks of taking the drug.,There was a feeling of complete disassociation from reality; people; feelings. I felt as if i was depressed. However at the same time I experienced times of being unable to control any emotions; my mood swings were extreme and I was completly unable to stop some fairly manic expressions of emotions. This could have been the nicotine withdrawal; but continued for a two - three month period. I stopped the drug about three weeks before prescribed as I became tired of the inability to feel happy / pleased / content. I experienced mild episodes of anxiety; vertigo and breathlessness - as I was aware these were side effects they did not overly concern me. ,I took one 150 mg tablet for seven days; stopped smoking on the sixth day. As prescribed I took one tablet twice a day for six weeks. After consulting the doctor over my cncerns of the side efeects I took one 150 mg tablet a day for the next four weeks.

I believe the damage caused is irreversable & would somehow like to know if anyone has came across anything like this in comparison & made any recovery.,The treatment details were to help you gradually stop smoking but the drug orders you to not smoke whilst taking the drug to the daily limit from up to two weeks; this is an illogical instruction as you might aswell of not taken the drug.

Do not take this drug; the side effects can be severe.  I had no previous issues with depression; and as soon as I started taking this drug; I developed severe depression; and changes in my personality.  Thankfully; my family noticed a change; and advised me and told me to stop taking Zyban.  It took 2 years to overcome the depression and over 3 years to begin to feel like myself again.  Stay away from this drug!  If you want to quit smoking; butt out and stick to your guns.  I quit; and it wan't the Zyban.  I have been smoke free for 10 years; and depression free for 7 or 8.  Someone should consider a class-action suit against the company which produces this drug.  Based on other reviews I have seen; I am not the only one who had these side effects.,I took this drug to quit smoking.  I am a female and was 28 years old at the time.

Before taking the mirapex; the patient got very little sleep and consequently was irritable.  After taking the mirapex; the restless legs calmed down immediately.  The patient can now go to a movie; take a trip in a car and sleep with a reasonable amount of comfort.  The restless legs are not totally cured; but it is manageable now.  Even working 8 hours a day is much more manageable.,The only side effect that the patient experienced was drowsiness and that has weakened as time has gone by.  With only taking one pill at noon; the drowsiness is not marked and does not interfere with work or anything else.  The patient takes 2 pills around 8 or 9:00 at night so the drowsiness is not a problem.,The patient developed restless leg syndrome around the age of 35 after a boating accident where her back was injured.  The doctors do not know if the back injury brought on the restless legs or not.  The patient went to many doctors and neurologists.  The doctors tried many medicines but with no success.  Finally the patient found a neurologist in central Kansas that figured out immediately what was wrong.  The doctor put the patient on mirapex on a trial basis after performing many tests to rule out other causes or problems.  The patient has never been on another medicine for restless legs since going on the mirapex.  The  patient does take a multivitamin with iron in it to help with the restless legs and the patient also does not have caffeine drinks.

I had seen Orthopedic Dr; Family practice (2); Endocrinologist and finally Nuerologist; who prescribed the Mirapex.  I did note slight improvement in leg pain however the weight gain issue was totally unacceptable to me and the benefit was only slight.  I have had much better results with Lyrica., Basically; I only noticed a huge weight gain of approximately 15 pounds.  I do not really recall any further side effects.  There were however; other side effects listed on the prescription contraindication form.  I do not recall what the side effects listed on that form were now.  ,he Doctor told me to take  he medication at bed time each evening. she also suggested that I might find it useful to sleep with a contour pillow between my thighs.  She said to get up and walk around rather than lie in bed tossing if I could not sleep.  As for the weight gain; it was recommended that I try to excercise more and reduce caloric intake.

I had to get up and walk around until the medication took effect and I was exhausted all the time. On Mirapex;  I am able to sleep at night without being awakened by my restless legs which is a huge relief for me and my husband. ,I have what I call a window of opportunity to take Mirapex by 7PM or I will be very "anxious" and highly uncomfortable due to the restless legs jumping and distress. It causes me to go to sleep shortly after taking it; which makes going to a movie theater almost impossible in the evening as I will sleep through most of the movie if I've taken my medicine.,I take Mirapex at 7PM every night so that I will not feel the effects of the Restless Legs Syndrome and will fall asleep; sleeping through the night in my bed without having to get up and walk around. This is a big relief to me and enables me to sleep in the same bed as my husband whereas before; I had to get up out of bed and walk briskly around the house. Now I am rested and able to function the next day. I have been part of a study group for Restless Legs Syndrome and I was the only one whose doctor had put them on Mirapex... others were on Requip and experiencing significant amounts of stress. After hearing about my experience with Mirapex; they were going to ask their doctors about it.

Sometimes it would wake me up and other times I didn't even know I was doing it; but the doctor told me that it was still disturbing my sleep.  While taking this drug; my legs and arms only jumped about 3 times in a 6 hr period.  All documented on sleep studies., I've heard that some people turn into gamblers.  Not a joke.  But I have never had any abnormal urges to gamble while taking it.  I am not a gambling person. In fact the medication has never made me want to do anything wrong or strange and I've never had trouble or side effects at all unless I suddenly stop taking it and then I can't sit still or sleep becuase I am jumping around.,I take a .25mg tablet every a.m. and then around dinner I take another one.  This keeps me from becoming jumpy in the daytime because I used to just be sitting there and my arm or leg would fly up or I'd feel the need to move.  I also take 1 mg at bedtime to stop my legs and arms from jumping in my sleep.  This has improved my quality of sleep immensely.

It made me drowsy at first; but once I took it for a few weeks; it just made my legs stay still so I could sleep.  I was told it is the same medication prescribed for parkinsons patients; but at a much lower dose.  I did need to take a but more as time went on; but it was still effective.  Unfortunately; I had to stop taking it when I got pregnant; since it is a category c medication.,I did need to take more as time went on; and I experienced augmentation of the restless leg syndrome.  The symtpoms would begin earlier in the evening and I would try to take the medication sooner; because if I did not take it before the symptoms set in; it was much less effective and would take longer to work.  That was really the only unfortunate effect of the medication.  ,I took one milligram at night to treat the symtoms of restless leg syndrome.  I had a sleep study which showed that my legs about every two minutes while I was sleeping and that brought me out of a deep sleep.  My doctor put me on requip to keep my legs still so I could fall asleep and get better rest.  It worked well.  I had tried all sort of behavioral remedies to help with my legs and nothing had helped until this medication.  I slept better than I ever had since I could really relax instead of waiting for the nightly discomfort in my legs.

I've been on a medically supervised diet to lose the weight I gained from the drug and have lost weight but not around my abdomen; it seems the Olanzapine can cause this type of weight gain.,I see a psychiatrist monthly.

It should be noted that although Zyprexa is classified as an A-typical antipsychotic; it is also used as a mood stabilizer in patients with Bipolar Disorder.  ,Increased appetite which of course lead to weight gain which caused me to feel depressed!  I am not exaggerating when I say my appetite was almost insatiable. Excessive sleepiness during the day which caused me to actually start falling asleep while talking to someone on several occassions.  It also made me feel almost "numb" emotionally.  Sedation along with an insatiable appetite caused me to gain over 25 pounds.,My psychiatrist prescribed Zyprexa to help with the mood swings of Bipolar Disorder.  I am classified as Bipolar Type II because I do not experience the extreme highs of mania (manic episodes) that accompany Bipolar Type I.

patient,48,female,allergies,none,none,Allegra (Fexofenadine) ,Antihistamines,7,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,25mg  taken once daily for the period of three years and counting,Treatment benefits were the cessation of allergy symptoms such as itchy eyes; itchy ears; itchy throat; sneezing; nasal drip; congestion and borderline asthma; however; during high allergy season; the regular dosage was insufficient; the beneficial effects lasting only about 12 hours; instead of the intended 24.  Then it was required twice daily to relieve symptoms described above.  ,Increasing the dosage to twice daily during high allergy season resulted in horrible side effects such as severe headache; nervousness; heart palpitations; dizziness; inability to concentrate; irritability; and the loss of appetite. I had to stop taking it altogether for four to five days; before I felt comfortable in taking it again.  Now I take only one/day regardless of the extent of allergies. ,Treatment details included; at first; a dosage first thing every morning; around 6am. During moderate allergy season; this lasted me until the following morning; but as soon as I got up at 6; symptoms came on full strength.  The Allegra did not take effect for an hour and a half.  So I started waking up at 5 to take it then; so that as I prepared for work I was able to do so without runny eyes; nose; etc.  But during the heavy allergy season (dogwood); I would take one at 5am and one at 6pm.

I have tried many products; but typically they are so drying that I am forced to discontinue use. This product is effective at reducing the production of mucus and eye irritation from a sever allergy to dust. I haven;t used this ,Generally; I find allergy medications; such as Claritin and Zyrtec to be too drying to be useful. I live in a dry city (Los Angeles) and I am prone to nose bleeds; dry eyes and dry skin. There is still some drying associated with this drug if I take it daily. However; if I take it occasionally; it is fine. I also can tolerate prolonged usage of this medication better than  I can other allergy medications.,The prescription says to take 1 tablet every day as needed for allergies. My allergist suggested I use this daily; as I have chronically dark circles under my eyes and a drippy nose; even though I have a home with zero carpet and have sealed my bed and pillows in allergen barriers. However; I do not take this daily because it is drying and costly to do so. I use this occasionally when I sleep at someone';s house or need to dust or sweep.

If I missed my dose however by hour 14 I would start to break out.  This would indicate to me that the histamine levels are ever present and the histamine blocker is what is keeping their ill effects at bay.  I have however discovered that recently my pharmacy changed their generic manufacturer and the new version is very ineffective.  I've had 5+ severe breakouts in 3 months ,Virtually none.

It caused severe cramping of the intestines due to lack of blood flow. At admittance to the ER; he was put on IV to increase the blood preassure. The doctors did not believe that the Norvasc could have a severe effect because the Lisinopril; which ordinarily is the medication that causes severe reactions; did not effect his blood pressure. The one Norvasc pill caused his blood pressure to go from 185/109 to 64/43. It is important for all doctors to realize that while drug testing can give you the general reaction of most people; it is imperative to be conscious that some patients will react in a completely unexpected way. This is a situation where the man's experience with opposite reactions to caffeine; and other "uppers" to the norm would have given some indication that his reactions to medications can be contra-indicated. ,Post emergency; the doctors felt that the reaction had to be caused by something else other than the Norvasc. They tested for urethral artery narrowing; kidney malfunction; etc. with all tests coming out normal. It was finally determined that the patients reaction to this medication was unusual; and the medication should not be repeated.

I have noticed increase in headaches since taking this med which i went to see a neurologist who wanted me to take neurontin but I refuse to take. He stated the headaches have nothing to do with the heart; but i disagree because when i have this chest pain; the headaches usually are there to; and when the chest pain isn't there; the headache isn't there.,increase in headache.,started out the first week with breaking 5mg in half. then after that been taking 5mg daily.

Crows feet and forehead lines also diminshed. Skin strength was greatly improved and I did not need to where make-up to hide imperfections as much; my skin looked more polished.,None,A dermatologist prescribed Retinova and told me that the longer I used it; the better the results would be. This proved to be correct. He told me to mix a pea sized portion with my usual moisturiser but to only use it once a day; I used it at night. He also stipulated that it was very important to use an effective sun block as Retinova increased sensitivity to sunlight. A number of people commented on the improvement in my skin. After about 12 months a large; brown patch of sun damage on my temple flaked off and didn't come back. I was very disappointed when I went to get my usual 3 month prescription and was told that Retinova was no longer available. I have subsequently used Retin-A but without the same visible results. This wasn't prescribed by the original dermaltologist; he didn't believe Retin-A was suitable for what I wanted to achieve for my skin. Over the counter products containing retinol do help smoothness a little; but nothing compared to the dramatic changes I experienced when I used Retinova. What amazed me the most was how quickly some of the changes occurred; within only a matter of days.

I was using just a small amount and still had trouble with irritation and small; watery itchy bumps appearing; primarily around my nose and mouth.  The prescription strength was probably too high and because it was purchased in Mexico it also may not have been from a trustworthy source. ,I had used Differin in the past with good results but was considerably younger then--in this last round I tried it hoping to reduce wrinkles but couldn't proceed with using it due to irritation etc.

So far I am happy with it- although even as an anti wrinkle treatment improves my skin- I continue to age- so it's an uphill battle. I do my best to take care of myself and had heard that this might help battle the little signs of age on my face. So far I'm pretty happy- nothing drastic; but hopefully continued use will help me to age gracefully and not drastically.,Definitely some peeling in the first 2-4 weeks especially around my chin. I also noticed that applying other products- like facial wash and sunscreen had a slight burning during the earlier stages.,I wash my face in the evening; let it dry; and apply the cream. It recommended that I wait 20-30 minutes after washing but I generally don't have that kind of time- I think that's to avoid irritation which isn't a problem anyway.

I previously discovered that I could not use anything other than very mild OTC retinoids; as they tended to make my acne flare up.  Finacea did not do this.  The Finacea was a good addition to my skin care regimen and has decreased the frequency of inflamed pimples and the tiny pustules I sometimes get around my nose.

From that perspective; the drug was somewhat effective.  However; the side effects were devastating and worse than dealing with the menopausal symptoms.  It took me two years to discern that the problems I encountered were attributable directly to the Premarin.,I developed strange lesions on my arms; which were sore and very embarrassing.  I could not wear short-sleeved shirts; because of the mess my arms had become.  Obviously; I showed them to the doctor; he simply shrugged his shoulders and said he didn't have a clue what might be causing the lesions.  When I went off the Premarin; on my own volition; the lesions disappeared to a significant degree.  When I added proteolytic enzymes and hydrochloric acid to my diet; the lesions disappeared completely.  I am now able to use bioidentical hormone replacement therapy with complete success and no side effects whatsoever.,The doctor put me on the maximum dosage because I was "young" for menopause.  Did not test estrogen levels either before beginning treatment or after starting the HRT.  I simply took one Premarin pill per day; every day.

Hopefully this "clean bill of health" will continue as I begin year 3 of tamoxifen in my 5 year plan. The benefits of effexor help balance the mood swings caused by a lowered amount of estrogen in my body. Tamoxifen does its job by keeping the estrogen blocked in my body so any abnormal cells can't feed on the estrogen. My cancer was highly estrogen-positive. Lowered estrogen causes depression and mood swings. Effexor helps to alleviate these symptoms along with my exercise regime and healthy eating habits. ,Side effects were more severe at the onset of taking tamoxifen. I had hot flashes that were quite severe. They often came without warning especially at mealtime. I also had some body aches and pains. Vaginal dryness was also severe. My period became erratic. After 2 years most side effects have decreased - hot flashes are gone as well as the aches. My period has been non-existant for 4 months. However; I feel irritable and edgy about the regularly scheduled time for a few days. The effexor helps. Dryness is still a problem but not as severe. Vaginal odor continues to be a concern. ,I was put on Tamoxifen for 5 years following my 9/05 breast cancer diagnosis. I started Tamoxifen 12/05. I started Zoloft 2 months later when I began having mood swings. Zoloft helped for a year then I felt my symptoms returning. I began Effexor at 75 mg and have been fine. My oncologist felt I am young and strong (age 46; exercise 4 times weekly; runner; martial artist) and that I should try to lower or end my Effexor. However; I didn't agree. I needed help with the mood swings and irritability. I can't lose my temper at work. I work with developmentally disabled adults. Losing my temper could be my job. I did try a natural regime of vitamins (B-12 and E) for several months but I felt no relief. Friends even told me about my mood. I went from depressed to angry in a flash. The 75 mg of Effexor is wonderful. My estrogen is blocked by the Tamoxifen and the effexor helps keep me at an even keel.

My skin is much smoother than before and starts having a beautiful glow (which it hasn't had in years!),I did have slight skin irritation during the first 2 weeks of use and after the second week I started having a few acne cysts (which is apparently a normal skin reaction during the first weeks of treatment). Nevertheless; I asked my doctor to put me on minocycline in order to avoid additional acne scars. This combination (Retin-A-Micro & Mincycline) works wonders!  ,I apply a thin layer of retin-a-micro gel every night after cleansing on my face and onto the acne prone areas on the chest. In order to avoid skin irritation; I used as little gel as possible during the first weeks. I think this is why I had only minor side effects. My skin has started to be used to the medication and I therefore can now use a bit more (though still a thin layer).

Though; applying a collagen eye product does tighten up the eyelids; but only on the surface; and causing the skin around the eye to crack following facial motions.  I was very self conscious about the wrinkles. After using Renova (I've been using it for about two month now); the wrinkles are smoothed; and where the skin easily wrinkles is firmed up; supple and elastic.                         ,For the initial two weeks; where I applied Renova caused a stinging sensation and a mild redness.  My eyes were watery for a few weeks as well.  Also; for that initial few weeks; the skin looked dry and the wrinkles looked worsened in that one-hour "drug-work" duration for which I didn't put on any moisturizer.  All the symptoms are gone now; and the skin is denser and firmer and I no longer fear people looking at my wrinkles anymore. ,I asked the doctor to prescribe Renova to me.

I feel the product did even out my skin tone at least somewhat however did not remove the larger areas of discoloration due to sun damage.  Overall the condition of my skin did improve; however the effects were not as dramatic as hoped.  This may be due to the discontinuation of the 0.05% formulation which would of course be more potent that the 0.02% that I could get.  I will try Retin A next time around to go for the 0.05% and see if results improve further.,Treatment side effects were overall very minimal.  I had been told to expect a considerable amount or redness and perhaps flakiness.  This never occurred whatsoever and virtually no affects from application itself were noted.  The two items that were noted is that I was initially not aware you could not receive waxing while using Renova and had a burn resulting from an eyebrow wax.  I also did find; as stated; that I would burn much more easily in the sun.,My skin care program prior to Renova was wash with Cetaphil; tone with a Paula Begoun antioxidant toner; 8% glycolic acid gel; moisturizer.  Same in the evening.  After adding Renova; same routine in morning but in evening I went to:  Wash with Cetaplil; tone with same product as before; wait 30 minutes; apply Renova.

I was insomniac. I took abilify 5mg for 3 mos; and then I upped it to 10mg. ,I became drowsy; however; with adequate sleep (10 hrs) there were no hangover effects; unlike zyprexa; for instance. I also experienced some cognitive blunting- that is to say that I could not think very well on my feet,the abilify decreased the need for daily klonopin. When I went off of it; I tapered down to 5mg for 4 weeks; then quit altogether. I had racing thoughts when I stopped; but these gradually diminished over several weeks. I also experienced about two months of hypomania; but this was goal-directed and positive for my functioning.

The retail theft occured while on just 5 mg of abilify. It effected my judgement/reasoning skills because I did not tell my doctor & allowed him to continue to increase dosage up to 15mg when I became expremely restless. Could not set down; paced for hours & called my doctor about this. Also during the 2 months I was taking this drug I charged a little over 15;000 on my credit cards that had no balance on them previously. If one did it was under $300. I still am currently unemployed & am having difficulty finding employement as a RN; due to my criminal record within the last year. If I had problems before taking antipsychotics; they were nothing compared to what I have now. ,I am only taking ativan & getting psychological therapy & trying to get out of the legal mess the drugs seroquel & abilify caused me. It definitely made my life now & in the future much; much worse.

Taking the Seroquel helps to ensure I have enough sleep so that depression doesn't often become a big problem. I know it's prescribed as anti-psychotic; but for me it's the effect ot drowsiness that my doctor desired; as I have no psychoses.

Better quality of sleep.,For the first few days of the use of Seroquel I had very bad nightmares. My nighmares felt so real that I almost stopped taking the medication. After about two day the nightmare just turned into very vivid dreams... sometimes very pleasant dreams. Seroquel also makes me urinate more often so I drink more water to stay hydrated.,I was diagnosed with PTSD after several negative incidents happened in my life. There was a point when I felt like I was going to crawl out of my skin. The doctor started me on Seroquel... a very high dose at first; 300mg. Later when I found out about some of it's very negative side effects such as TD; I started taking only 100mg a night. And soon I will try to lower that dosage.

After about a week I began to get extremely moody - crying a lot; getting very angry and agitated.  It appeared that once the medication started building up in my system the side effects became worse and worse.  It was not worth it and I quit the medication within a few weeks.

Cleared the mind completely; did not dream at night; and did not wake during the night. ,Difficulty waking up.  Grogginess during the entire morning. Inability to clearly focus throughout the day; due to the grogginess.  Increased frequency of migraines; in a person already subject to migraines.,Prescribed to be taken nightly as needed.  Originally prescribed 20 mg; increasing to 40 mg; and potentially increasing to 60 mg if needed for a 135 lb woman.

I lowered my dosage and live the sound sleep.  it knocked out my delusions and hallucinations; hopefully for good.,weight gain is the worst side effect; but a small price to pay for sanity.,I actually ended up with motion disorders from all the other meds; the worst one being parkinsons for over a year.  I had to take parkinsons drugs. It was so scary drooling all the time and looking stone faced; no expression.  I dont feel any signs of this with the seroquel.

I only took them for a couple of days; but had to stop because of the side-effects. ,The biggest side-effect was that it made me experience shock-waves through my head and sometimes even my body; just like if someone would have turned on and off a lamp very quickly. That side-effect ended the same time I stopped taking Seroquel. The other one was that everything started to smell and taste very bad. It ,I was prescribed with Seroquel after I was released from hospital after a period of deep depression to help me to sleep better and stop me from becoming hypomanic.

I've noticed a decrease in the speed of my thoughts and can concentrate much better than before. ,I find it gives me pretty severe tremors in my hands. It doesn't happen as often as it used to; but when it does it's almost a minute before it stops. Also I get extemely vivid dreams; usually about mundane things. Some light headedness and dizziness still occurs; but the instances are few and far between now.,Was hospitalized for two weeks after a suicide attempt. Was treated in hospital and released after properly medicated and was of sound mind.

Would wake up around 5 times a night. With the Seroquel I only wake up a couple times a night. ,its a God send. I dont feel any side effects!!,Start at 50mg for two nights. Then increased to 100mg. Two weeks later increased to 200mg.

Everyday I feel I am sweating all these nasty chemicals out of my skin; I feel weak; fatigued; numb and motionless; I am not climbing the walls of my room anymore; instead I sleep 20hours at a time and when i wake i want to eat everything in my house and go back to sleep. I cant function normally; yes i can be out in society and safe as it takes away my urges; but i feel emotionally numb; i can't cry and at night my legs twitch untill i pass out. Yes i am not trying kill myself; but am i really living like this?,I started off on 25mg daily; mosved up to 150mg night and 100mg morning and now i am on 300mg of the XR Seroquel. 
patient,26,female,anxiety,low level depression,Cymbalta; Lamictal,Seroquel (Quetiapine) ,Antipsychotics Antipsychotics Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,200mg  taken once daily for the period of three months,None.,Seroquel caused severe paranoia in larger doses; severe tiredness in lower (25 50 and 100mg)doses.  Paranoia was so severe; any simple noise caused erratic heart rate and rapid breathing. Drug also caused an inability to move; as if being restrained or weighed down in larger doses. After two years of not taking the drug; and only a week at the highest dosage; there are still problems with low lying feelings of paranoia. Ex; being afraid to go outside at night or be near a window at night or anywhere alone during the day when that was never a problem before the medication. ,25mg once at bedtime to start first week; then 50; 75; 100; 150; then 200mg final dosage after weekly increase. Tiredness was suppose to subside in increased dosages; which really I feel it was so highly increased that it had a reverse affect and made it impossible to sleep or move or even hear a pin drop without thinking it was the front glass door being broken into.
patient,31,female,bipolar I,none,lithium; paxil,Seroquel (Quetiapine) ,Antipsychotics Antipsychotics Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,100mg  taken once daily and as needed for the period of 2 yrs; still on it,The benefits were numerous; I don't have panic attcks for the first time in 20 yrs; and if I do; they are less than 20 seconds.  I haven't had a mixed state or very rapid cycling since getting on it 2 years ago.  These symptoms continued to get more severe until I got on this drug.  Every episode was worse and lasted longer.  This drug gave me my life back.  I lost my job(s) and wound up in psychiatric inpatient care.  But I have become steadily better since first taking the drug.  I have to admit; to get to the point I'm at now took 2 years; but it's better then I was; and it's better than not getting better at all.  The longer I'm on Seroquel; the better I feel.  Also; I am able to sleep because of Seroquel.  At the worst when I went into the hospital I couldn't sleep at all which was making my episode even worse.  Sleeping drugs and benzodiazepines such as valium that were given to me made me feel horrible; very tired the next day; and even made me panic.  Anticonvulsants and even other psychotics gave me panic attacks; made me antsy or made me so tired I couldn't even function in day to day life.  Seroquel doesn't make me real tired; but it  has made a sleep schedule possible again.  I also don't feel too tired in the morning.,There are side effects of course; as there are with any drug.  I have a little more stomach troubles than what I started with but that could be due to the Lithium.  I have also had about 20 pounds of weight gain.  Before the seroquel I was thin with a high metabolism.  My weight is steady now; but at 20 lbs higher than it used to be.  I tried losing the weight but it has been impossible to get it off.  The drug doesn't make me groggy but I know some people on it that it just knocks out.,I have been on and off lithium and paxil for years.  I tried zyprexa; depakote Triliptal and Lamictal; but these made meunfunctionally tired or I had severe reactions to them.  I have a problem where drugs create severe reactions and sensitivity in me so dr.s give small amounts of several rather than a mega dose of one.  I tried Risperdal but it gave me severe panic attacks and restlessness.  I started out with an antipsychotic and lithium at the hospital to bring the mania and mixed states down.  Later I switched to seroquel and Paxil was added to help with my anxiety and depression.  I was on Seroquel at a lower dose than most 200mg to start; 900mg lithium (anymore than that makes me very sick even though the blood tests show it's within normal limits)and Paxil at 25mg.  Now 2 years later; as I am not in a severe episode I can get by on half the Paxil; 50 mg Seroquel and the lowest Lithium possible to keep it in treatment range.  I raise the doses if I have to (with permission of the Nurse practitioner)and I take 25-50mg Seroquel as needed throughout the day if I need to for anxiety; although I don't need to very often.  The combination of seroquel; Paxil and lithium works best together for me.
patient,36,female,Anxiety/mild PTSD,depressive episodes,none,Seroquel (Quetiapine) ,Antipsychotics Antipsychotics Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,25 mg/day  taken once at night for the period of 3 weeks-current,Stopped the constant racing thoughts at night.  Finally could get some decent sleep.  Before I'd lay in bed for hours on end thinking and thinking over and over until I was nuts.  Now am able to sleep an entire night through with less paranoia to boot...,grogginess in the AM; definitely.  Have to take some kind of caffeine pill to get going otherwise; I am a zombie.  I have a job where I have to be 100% focused all day; and it's difficult getting out of the morning fog sometimes.,I know there are issues with weight gain.  Because of the sedative effects; this makes natural sense.  I would advise people to try to incorporate as much exercise in their daily lives as possible to combat the weight gain.  Also; if you typically take the drug at night; as I do; try not to eat at least 3 hours before bedtime.  This is hard; but I have learned it is a small sacrifice so I feel more mentally stable.  
patient,37,female,sleep aid,anxiety,paxil,Seroquel (Quetiapine) ,Antipsychotics Antipsychotics Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents,4,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,100mg  taken 1x a day for the period of 2 mo,This drug knocked me out i did not wake during the night nor did I remember any dreams. It was difficult to get up in the morning.. This drug is an effective sleep aid but with recent concerns i think there are better choices...,The worst side effect was that I gained weight at an alarming rate; almost like I had diabetes. Also the drug made me feel zombie like and flat....I think this too strong a choice as a sleep aid and there are better choices.,Doctor perscribed this with paxil for and anxiety disorder. This was meant to help me sleep which it did and it  REALLY knocks you out...do not take this drug and drive you will feel like a zombie...

After sleeping for over 10 hours; I spend the next 6 hours after I wake up foggy-headed and VERY lethargic. After this I usually feel good again.,I mainly suffer from severe depression and anxiety but after a couple weeks of this I sometimes suffer from 2 or 3 days of mania.

The confusion; being in a daze part was the worst.  I couldn't remember where my Doctor's office was located and I live in a small town and less that two miles from his office.  My thinking cleared up as soon as I stopped taking the Seroquel.  This was an awful medication for me.  ,I took 200 mg at night at first.  This was then decreased to 25 mg at night to help me sleep.

The patient started having delusions as well as other bizarre behavior and the family could not convince the patient otherwise.  The patient was also on renexa which is known to be a strong inhibitor and I believe caused the seroquel to attain toxic blood levels.  The family tried to contact the psychiatrist to discuss the problems but before this occurred; the patient went into v-fib miles from a hospital.  It was more than 20 minutes before the life saving crew arrived at the scene and even longer before the patient arrived to the ER for treatment.  The patient was pronounced dead on the scene.,The patient was referred to the psychiatrist by his cardiologist secondary to depression and increasing insomnia.  The patient had been on welbutrin for years for depression and smoking cessation.  The psychiatrist kept the patient on welbutrin and added xanax for anxiety and seroquel for sleep at bedtime.  Slowly the family started noticing strange behavior; delusions; and almost dementia type characteristics in the patient that occured over a 4 month period and began to get more severe.  The family attempted to talk about the changes with the patient but as true delusional behavior dictates; the patient was unable to see any of the changes.  The forgetfulness; clumsiness; and personality changes such as irritability increased.  The family attempted to contact the psychiatrist but in interim; the patient died of a cardiac arrest.  Even after talking to the psychiatrist after the patient's death; the psychiatrist denied that seroquel had any affect on the situation.  The family and myself as the primary caretaker believe that seroquel was directly responsible for the patient's death.  We do not plan to seek legal retribution but hope that anyone that reads this will be more cautious about prescribing seroquel in someone that already has cardiac problems and to please be careful about it's possible interactions with other medications!

I also am a professional. I now have a record for criminal retail theft that was reduced to a misdemeanor. I tried abilify next; almost a year later & had the same side effect-memory loss & retail theft. All my life I have been a law abiding citizen with no criminal record until I tried 2 different antipsychotic medications & both caused me memory loss & had a effect on my reasoning. Yes; abilify made my feel real good; but it caused me to enter into a type 2 bipolar manic phase. I am now charged again with retail theft. I feel stongly that the antipsychotics cause these severe memory loss & lack of judgment for actions being commited. I am now 50 years old & can't get a job due to my criminal record.

Then moved to 600mg and doing fine..  I think a person needs to find the minum dose that works to avoid side effects.  I am told that many people need high doses in the 600 to 800mg range to get results..

I have taken it along with several different combinations of meds; but the Seroquel has remained in my regimen for the past 5 years. I play with the dosage and make my own changes (25 mgs at a time) based on how I'm doing; so I've taken between 200 and 400 mgs at any given time. The effects I attribute to the Seroquel include lessening of depression; anxiety and aggression. ,Dry mouth; vivid dreams (I remember most of my dreams from the past 5 years); extreme lethargy (the Wellbutron helps counteract that),I currently take 200 mgs at night before bed along with 200 mgs of Lamictal and Wellbutron.

Depression and fatique were a result of lack of deep sleep. Seroquel allowed the patient to obtain deep (REM) sleep allowing for a rejuvinated physical state that; in turn; lifted the mood and outlook of the patient.,Headache and drowsiness during the day were the number one and two side effects. The drowsiness was kept in check by adjusting the doseage downward.,Seroquel is usually used as an antipsychotic medication and/or used for manic depression.

During the time I took this medication; I had no emotional reations to anything; even things that I should have. I felt like a zombie the whole time. I've been off the medication for a few years now; but from that period of time; I only have 2 memories. ,I took 200 mg of seroqeul in the morning and before bed; 1000 mg of depakote morning; afternoon; and night; and 10mg risperdol morning; afternoon; and night. Most of the side effects are probably becuase I should never have been taking that many medications at once and the ammount of them; but that is how they were prescribed to me.

Considering beforehand; even while not in a noted phase I would have serious problems sleeping; this is a welcome effect.,something which I'm not sure if I can blame the seroquel for; I sometimes get very mild but discomforting pains just under my left collarbone. Not like heart-chest pain (from what I'd imagine it's like); but a different pain. Hopefully my heart doesn't explode randomly.,09-April 09; Increasing doses of Seroquel; up to 300. Also Wellbutrin; starting at 50 and eventually reaching 300. The wellbutrin made me considerably more depressed than I was before; and I stopped taking it. Since then it's been the seroquel; and I've been mostly stable since.

I take it about 2.5 hours before I actually want to get to sleep; and it lulls me into a very deep sleep. I rarely remember dreams.

Highly recommended for people with severe insomnia and/or rapid mood swings. ,Weight gain and some grogginess in the morning. I am no longer a size 10; but I'm okay with it because sleep keeps me sane. ,I take one 100mg tablet about 2 hours before I go to bed (I have a slow metabolism).

The alendronate did not seem to stop the slow progression of my osteopenia; as measured by yearly bone density scans. I tried a regular exercise program; using a vibration machine (powerplate) and that stopped the progression of my osteopenia. I stopped the alendronate medication; thinking the exercise was more helpful and I was afraid of side effects.  However; the exercise alone did not work. I have re-started the alendronate medication and am hoping that the combination of the medication and exercise will help. ,I have a bad taste in my mouth the day I take the alendronate medication and worry about side-affects; including long-term side affects which are undetectable currently. ,I take the medication 1/wk.

My doctor said it was not useful to do another bone scan to see if there had been a change in a year so I have no idea if there was any benefit.  I have been experiencing fairly severe leg pains for the past year and could not find out what they were from.  Did numerous tests; no results.  Then I saw on the insert that side effects could be muscle; bone or joint pain and when I read a comment on here describing dull aching in one leg in particular radiating down from the hip and below the knee. I thought...that is me!!!  So I am stopping this drug and waiting to see what happens with the new aches and pains.  Maybe it is this drug.  I hope so.,See above.,Took alendronate for osteoporosis for over a year.

I was an avid camper and hiker; and I lost a considerable amount of endurance and strength in my whole body.  Leg pain woke me up several times during the night.  The leg pain was not like cramping; but more like general dull aching; only sometimes severe.  By the third month I could not lie on my side (one side was worse than the other); because the pain was so intense.  I felt it resonating from my hip joint and going down my legs. When I awoke in the morning; my usual sprint to the bathroom was replaced by tiny hobbling steps; I was extremely weak in the morning.    ,I elected to stop taking Fosamax because of side effects (above).  My physician is concerned and wants me to try a different osteoporosis medication; but I am afraid to take anything like that again.

Looked down her throat with a camera to see if there was any blood clots around her heart.  Ruptured her esophagus.  Never did find out what caused this but i figure the fosamax caused a very very small hole in the esophagus; weakened the side and the camera scope tore a hole. When fixed; there was no more pain in the stomach.  She is alright now--but almost died from this,See above for treatment details as I don't know what more I could say.  She is healthy now from this.  Fosamax and this type of drugs are not very good for some people.

One hip was stable and one had lower bone density,none,I took the fosamax with 8 oz. of water and walked around for an hour.The first couple of years I did not take calcium supplements.  Then I did.  Since I do not think the results were really an improvemrnt; Now I am taking a calcium supplement with vitamin D and magnesium and a fairly new drug called foseum which is suppose to be entirely natural like an herb; but more expensive than fosamax that must be taken twice a day.

Actual acid reflux disappeared within a few days; but symptoms feeling like a hard; sometimes painful lump in my esophagus persisted for months; especially when lying down.  Even after giving up Fosamax 2 months after initial symptoms occurred (in Sept '07; the condition persisted.,I was sent by my general practitioner for an endoscopy 3 months (Dec '07) after giving up Fosamax; results of which showed irritation of end of esophagus tube where it joins my stomach.  I was prescribed Nexium for the condition; and after taking for 3-4 months; the symptoms finally disappeared.  I would NEVER take Fosamax or any alendronate based or similar drug again.
patient,45,female,osteoporosis,none,e-string (estradiol vaginal ring) ,Fosamax (Alendronate) ,Antiresorptives Bisphosphonates Bone-Metabolism-Regulators Hypocalcemia Osteoporosis,4,Ineffective,Mild Side Effects,70mg  taken once a week for the period of 3 1/2 years +,in theory; my bones should have gotten stronger; as measured by the bone scan done at my gynecologist office once every 18 months,I first tried the tablets and they would sit on my stomach as if I had a brick for breakfast. So I tried the oral solution which; in fact; was better on the stomach but;still; not completely without side effects. Most of the days I took Fosamax I had a slight stomach discomfort during the morning. ,I took Fosamax for almost 4 years and after 2 bone density scans which showed no improvement  I decided to stop the treatment; against my doctor advice which was to take Fosamax for at least 5 years. I believe that we still do not know enough about how the bone keeps itself healthy and that bone scans are not yet reliable. It's a big business and I finally refused to keep a medication that is so hard on the digestive system and can also have very dangerous side effects (frozen bones; I believe it is called). I still have to be convinced that a low density bone is not necessarily stronger than a bone with more density. Waiting for more research I am trying to walk as much as possible and to follow a reasonable diet. And to be at peace with myself...  Thanks!

Always taken with a full glass of water and nothing else was consumed for a least 30 min.  There were no digestive problems even though I had long standing reflux.  I was also told to take a pepcid AC the night before to reduce acid reflux and increase absorption of the fosamax.  I think the Pepcid AC may have helped.,91.37 mg alendronate sodium taken once weekly with a full glass of water stabilized bone density; but did not increase bone density over a three year period.

I also have to wait at least 1/2 hour before taking a drink of juice; coffee; tea; etc. This drug can also cause heartburn.,There is really not much to describe.  I now take the drug once a week instead of once everyday and am very happy with taking it this way.  As I mentioned above; as per my doctor's instructions; I also take Caltrate Plus 3x400mg.tablets a day; as he feels this will also help to strengthen and build my bones and keep them from becoming brittle.

I had experienced some bone density issued related to  long term use of Prednisone or a period of years.,Within two weeks of the first dose I began feeling a lump in my upper stomach ;even though I took my pill first thing in the morning and remained standing for more than two hours. I still started to have a feeling of acid reflux which I have never had.  I reported continuing burning sensations in upper abdomen ;and gasy production which produced belches and burps ; to the prescribing Dr. immediately but he suggested continuing the med ;and use an antacid which I tried. By the second dose I had serious heartburn ;reported it to the Dr. then discontinued the medication and they changed me to Actonel; once a week ;which had none of the same adverse side effect.,did but the issued reported above;meant I had to switch to another similar but milder medication ; Actonel  and take it one lowered dose pill a week.

I took one tablet on the same day each week with plenty of water first thing in the morning and stood upright for the next two hours as I prepared for work. The side effects were numerous and severe; and with continued use compounded themselves to the point that I feared I may not survive the year. My physician at the time refused to believe me and insisted that I continue taking the drug. I began intense research on my own and discovered I was not alone; and would have to make every attempt to save myself. ,The side effects began with nausea and stomach pains mirroring acid reflux which even Nexium could not relieve. Then difficulty breathing and irregular heartbeat; extreme fatigue and body aches; finally vomiting matter resembling coffee grounds - really scary! ,After extensive research; I began a complete detoxification process accompanied by acupuncture which I believe ultimately saved my life. My advice: listen to what your body is telling you; be aware and be pro-active with your treatments.

I took Fosamax from 2003 to 2007; when my gynocologist switched me to Boniva.  From what I've heard lately; Merck knew of this problem but would not publish information regarding what could happen to other bones.,April 29; 2010 I broke my femur (rt leg) mid-thigh due to a pre-fracture very possibly caused by taking Fosamax.  Clearly from the x-rays my body was trying to heal the fracture.  After walking I would notice an aching at the site about 3-4 months before it broke.  I did not fall hard nor far--just about a foot and landed on my right foot.  This is obviously a huge consequence for taking this drug.  ,Surgery and rod implanted in my right leg; thigh to knee.  It is also a long recovery and rehabilitation from walker to crutches and cane.

After I received my bone density results in 2006; my physician put me on Fosamax; which I have taken regularly for the past two years.  When I took a bone density test recently in 2008; my bone mineral density had increased by almost 6% over a two-year period. I remain in the range of osteopenia; but am midway now between normal and osteoporosis in my T-scores.      ,I have experienced no adverse side effects at all while taking this medication.,I take a pill in the morning when I get up; once a week; on the same day each week.  I take it with an 8 ounce glass of water and do not lay down; eat; or drink anything for at least 30 minutes. I also take calcium/d vitamin supplements daily; eat plenty of dairy products; walk at least 3 times a week; and avoid alcohol and soft drinks.  I was already following these dietary habits when my previous bone density tests were done.  Because of that; I credit fosamax with the improvement  that has taken place.

I have been on it again for 3mos...I feel better...less pain..more energy.,I have not experienced any side effects.,I am fortunate that I have good insurance coverage because it is very expensive. As with any medicine...I am concerned about possible long term side effects.  However...my grandmother had RA and was severely crippled with the disease.

However; the benefit outweighs the liability. I would also recommend that the patient have good insurance. This medication is very expensive.

I no longer have any stiffness; except for when its cold or if I grip something for a while; but it doesn't last for hours like it used to.  The swelling in my joints has signficantly decreased.  Unfortunately; the medicine has not stopped my flare-ups; which only last for a 2-4mnths at a time on a finger joint or toe joint.  Nor has it prevented osteoarthritis in my feet.  I am also struggling to find that right dose that helps with the fatigue.   ,I got pneumonia after the first treatment and it took 3 months for it to go away.  My breathing hasn't been the same since; I've to see a pulmonary specialist every couple months to manage the constant asthma that I now have.  I have also gained approx 25 while taking the medicine; although it's not supposed to be a side-effect.  This is what bothers me most; extra weight puts more strain in my joints.  I also have frequest yeast infections.  I have almost constant sinus congestion.    ,I recieve an infusion every 8 wks.  Since I started a year 18 months ago; we have; recently increased the dose and have shortedn the interval at which I recieve the medication.

Mine is fibrostenotic crohn's.  I had a stricture that was causing my pain; but severe bathroom visits.  The stricture was fixed with surgery.  The frequency of the bathroom visits is lessend with Remicade.  It helps within 1 to 1 1/2 weeks.  The only bad thing is that I find myself needing it desparately at 7 weeks.  I suffer for 2 weeks then until I can get it and let it start working again.,No side effects for me.,It takes 10 minutes to get registered.

I am always tired even though I am finally sleeping most of the night; I have developed the bumps on the forhead that everyone talks about; and I have the need to constantly unrinate. I have been reading reviews online now for a week and am getting concerned because most comments show that people find the side effects worse than the condition and I have just started. I believe that I am also suffering from depression; but because I am a single parent I try to keep myself busy with family issues which allows me to put aside the bad feelings temporarily.,Have done 3 infusions; starting with 2 weeks after first and then 4 weeks. Now I am awaiting my 4th which will be 8 weeks. The staff have been great; from the nurse who does the procedure to the councillor at Bio-Advance; but the one draw back is that I have been telling both the nurse and the councillor about my side effects and they acted so surprised. So why did I find out by going online myself that these side effects are common?

My mouth was so dry my tongue  literally stuck to the roof of my mouth making it difficult to speak. The Copaxone causes lumps and itching at the injection site.,When Zyrtec alone didn't controll my allergies my doctor prescribed the Veramyst to try. This combination seems to be working; Zyrtec once a day and Veramyst twice daily. The Baclofen 10mg.is taken as needed one to four times a day. Sometimes I'm not bothered with spasticity too often but when I am I take the Baclofen and it works.Amitriptyline tabs 25mg are taken before bedtime.Requip tabs .5mg are taken in the evening. Gabapentin 300mg is taken 3-4 times a day depending on the severity of pain. Tetracycline HCL 250mg is taken once a day. The Copaxone 200mg is injected once a day.

Sometimes; especially in the middle of the night; the pressure would return slightly.  Instead of having to go to the bathroom 2-3 times during the night; I was able to only have to get up to urinate once a night.  ,I would wake up with a very hoarse voice.  Usually; the hoarsness would disappear during the day; but sometimes my voice would crack when I spoke.  Also; your throat is dry and irratated.  It's almost like you feel like you're getting a bad sore throat but it never quite turns into one.  My mouth was a little dry; but hardly noticable.,I was prescribed it after a bladder infection; which was cleared up; lead to a pressure feeling in my bladder.  I take the medicine once a day.  I guess the medicine is slow releasing but once in a while I felt like I should take a dose earlier than prescribed.  I am also scheduled for physical therapy on the muscles of my bladder wall; but have not started them yet.  I did this kind of therapy 10 years ago when my bladder had this same pressure feeling and the therapy did help--I'm looking forward to starting it and hopefully getting off the medication.

I usually had to urinate every 20-30 minutes. Now I can go as long a 2-3 hours. I find I need to take it as soon as I get up for the best results.  If I wait I have a morning of running to the bathroom. I used to get up around 3-4 times a night and now get up only once.,None of the side effects that are usually mentioned.  However; I do now have restless legs at night which I have not mentioned to my dr yet.  I hadn't thought it was related to the detrol until I saw on another post that someone else was complaining of restless legs at night after taking detrol? So I will mention it to my dr. because it is very annoying. The only other side effect is some drowsiness in the afternoons but it does pass.,I had been suffering for years with an overactive bladder but had never brought it up to my dr. until our daughter was getting married in Jamaica and I just knew I could never make it without some help.  Doctor gave me sample and I saw improvement and tolerate it well so I have been on it ever since.

A switch to plain Detrol (2mg) twice a day proved to work much better.

I was diagnosed two years ago with Multiple Sclerosis and have a spastic bladder.  Soon after being prescribed Detrol LA; I had a definite decrease in urination frequency.  However; after about six months; my urinary habits returned to pre-medication levels.  I void every two hours.  About one year ago; I stopped taking Detrol LA for two months; thinking that giving my bladder a break from the med would help.  I then restarted Detrol LA and noticed no difference.  I am seriously thinking about stopping the medication.  It is essentially useless.,Mild dry mouth.  Otherwise; no side effects.,I have been on Detrol LA for since being diagnosed with Multiple Sclerosis two years ago.  I have a spastic bladder and urinate every two hours.  I take 2mg twice a day.  The medicine worked for about six months; then was virtually ineffective.

But the main benefit is that the lesions that I was originally diagnosed with DID NOT WORSEN over time.  In addition;  I have had NO new lesions since beginning betaseron.  So this has helped to slow the progress (secondary progressive relapse/remit) and I believe decreased the amount of relapses with residual.  Which; if you have ms this is what you aim for.,I do; for some unknown reason; still have side effects from the betaseron.  They don't happen every injection; and there is no pattern.  I will have a fever and/or chills; and I hurt all over.  It feels sometimes like even my hair hurts:)   And my injection sites do have a tendency to form large red circles; but they are NOT infections; just a side effect.  And for some reason the injections on my legs hurt the worst.,I guess the treatment details are how I take it.  The injections are deep subcutaneous.  Because the drug is very hard on tissue; you can't inject into the same area.  Upper arms are divided into 6 imaginary sections; abdomen 6 areas; legs 6 areas; and buttocks 6.  So inject into first arm area on one arm; then next injection opposite arm; then abdomen; legs; and buttocks.  Then you must start over in the first arm; but a different section and then work your way down again.  This keeps tissue necrosis from occuring.  The injections are every other night; and come in a pre-measured syringe the must be mixed SLOWLY with the powder immediately before injection.  MAKE SURE to NOT agitate the sol'n; as it will foam; then you can't get it in the syringe; and then it's useless.

I tried to get myself to the gym; but I was too tired all the time.  I tried other appetite suppresents; like hoodia; but nothing seemed to work.  The I finally talked the doctor in to prescribing me phentermine.  She was reluctant because I have high  blood pressure and I take medicine for that.  But I took my blood pressure everyday for the 3 months and I had NO increase in pressure as long as I took my medicine.  Unfortunately; after the three months; I had only lost 5 lbs. which; I always seemed to fluctuate anyway.  So to recap; phentermine did absolutely nothing for me.

It also gave me alot of energy so working out didn't seem like such a chore anymore.  I felt more refreshed and awake in the morning instead of wanting to hit the snooze button over and over.,At first when I started the phentermine; it made me very thirsty and a little bit jittery but that wore off after about a week.  I also had trouble falling asleep at first if I didn't take the medication early enough in the morning and woke up quite a bit throughout the night. These side effects all diminished after about a month of usage.,First I had to fill out a patient questionaire & submit blood for some blood work that was required.  I was prescribed to take one pill after breakfast in the morning. I also went in for weekly weigh ins and measurements.   They also gave me some vitamins to take along with the phentermine but I did not take those since I hate having to take any kind of pills.  Overall I am very happy with the results achieved from taking phentermine and occasionally take them when I feel myself getting off track again.

And the worst was the headache!  I wish I had taken my blood pressure.  I think it was probably very high.,There are not treatment details really.  I was overwieghtand not loosing even though I was followinga strict diet and eating well.  I needed to up my metabolism.  It worked.  But aftera week of no sleep and bad headaches; I decided it wasn't worth it.

It was not EASY; but it gave me the drive to keep going because I wasn't so miserable while doing it. I ate a 1200 calorie a day or less diet and exercised many times a week...so I would have lost weight anyway; but it just made it easier.,Dry mouth; constipation at times; sometimes felt a bit like my heart raced under stress after taking it for a long time. ,One tablet a day for about a year to help aid in weight loss.  I have been able to keep it off give or take a few pounds; almost a year later.

It is also supposed to give energy.  It definitely worked for cutting my appetite as long as I took it twice a day.  If I took it once a day at about 8 am I would feel hungry at about 5pm.  If I took it twice a day 8 am 10am I could make it to bedtime without being hungry.  ,Side effects were random for me most of the times.  I would definitely NOT feel the energy that it was supposed to give me.  Sometimes when I would take it it would have the opposite affect on me and actually make me crash.  On some days it would make me feel foggy and other days I'd feel crisp and clear.  I also broke out with pimples on it.  You have to remind yourself to eat.  Some days I'd also have trouble falling a sleep.,I would take 1 30mg pill in the morning at about 8am and then another 30mg pill at about 10am (sometimes trouble falling asleep if taken later).  I have done that for 2 months.  At the beginning I started off with only 1 pill a day.  I try to "self administer" my breaks in taking the medicine because I've heard it was addictive and I don't want to be addicted.

A friend of mine used Adipex (Phentermine) and lost 40 pounds in 4 months so I had to try it.  I started taking it last October 08 and by Christmas I had to buy all new pants because my other ones were WAY too big.  Total I lost 25 pounds and am now 130. I just started taking it again after being off of it for 3 months because I didnt want to get too addicted which I know you can from this drug; and you also build up an immunity to it; which I also did. Overall though; it definitely works to loose weight; my sister-in-law; my best friend; and my sister all took it and my sister lost the least so far(only been on it for 1 month) with 15 pounds. ,Bad trouble sleeping. WIll fall asleep after a little trouble; but cannot stay asleep; wake up several times a night unable to get good rest. Have to take sleep aide with this drug or wont sleep at all!

I had more energy and felt the desire to "do things."  During the day I did not think about food; and had no desire to eat.  I felt good and didn't care about eating.  It left you with a feeling of being happier too.,It immediately "woke" you up.  I had a hard time; going straight to sleep at night.  I generally stayed awake about 2 hours later than I normally did.  But in the morning I wasn't overly tired; and as soon as I took the next pill within 30 minutes I had no desire to go back to sleep.  Also sometimes I would have a funny taste in my mouth.,Well their wasn't much treatment details.  You take the pill first thing in the morning and drink a glass of water with it.  It is an appetite suppressant.   It also gave me more energy as well; giving me more incentive to exercise; work around my house; etc....

As I only had to lose 10kg I am not sure that I was the best candidate.,I was warned about blood pressure; kidney; and liver problems; I was told to look out for the shakes and a general feeling of being "on speed".  I admit the only side effects I felt was a slight case of feeling light headed; I found I had a lot more energy.,I have found this medication worked quite well for me but I only lost minimal weight but it did help me develop better eating habits.  At first I was hesitant as apparently it can disturb blood pressure and as I was using minoxil at the same time but I have not experienced anything bad from this.

Not that way at all but it is a aid to get to your goal,jittery.. sometimes euphoric.. tired but cant sleep.. in a zone. ,meats; dairy is low fat or fat free yogurt. Daily vitamin and lots and lots of water to replenish so you don't get fatigued.  Im on my way.. 5 pounds down and 25 to go. Good luck this can work for most people with no excuses other then a underlying disease .. if so its obvious you shouldn't be taking adipex. Good luck all .. dont get weak. and if you mess up make sure its worth it.. that extra serving dont let it be more then a half cup and only if you can burn it off. Good Luck all and remember don't give up.. don't cheat yourself with extra licks from the brownie bowl.. tasting samples of dinner before serving. those are huge calories not counted for that can ruin your diet.

This med suppresses my appetite so much that I have to remind myself to eat and have absolutely no desire for food if I don't eat. I can already tell that I've lost inches and pounds; but I haven't been on the scale to see exactly how much yet. I have only been exercising moderately; although the feeling of energy is incredible and makes me get up and do everything!!! My doctor was cautious in giving to me because of my high blood pressure; but fortunately my BP meds have my condition well under control; so I just keep track of my daily reading to ensure there are no spikes. I feel like this really works so far!,I've read the side effects; but honestly; I can't say that I've experienced more than a couple of mild headaches and feeling that slight "elated" feeling. I already experience night sweats & some insomnia due to menopause; so I can't tell a difference in those categories. ,I have a 30-day supply and based on what I've read about the addiction; I have not decided if I will continue beyond a 90-day regimen.

The next day I was sore; as can be expected.  But I also had HUGE bruises in the spots where I guess I made the most contact or the most severe impact.

The angiogram was required as the patient (myself) has a calcium score of about 4000 (extremely high) and had  complained of minor episodes of intermittent weakness in the hands and feet. The angiogram revealed a number of partial arterial blockages being treated first with Lipitor and currently with Crestor; niacin and aspirin.,Mino9r bleeding from the surfacen of the skin in a couple of occasions; minor bruising also in a couple of occassions.,I took the tablet once a day; in the morning; together with my other prescribed medications.

By the third month; even with waiting a couple of hours after taking the pill before any food was consumed; the food did not stay down at all.

Due to side effects I was only able to take a single dose. I am now hoping that I do not have permanent damage from the single dose. Time will tell. ,Extreme agonizing bone pain in neck and ribs; high fever for 1 1/2 days; debilitating pain in shoulder and neck to the point that I could not get out of bed for 4 days. I subsequently read that it can aggravate previous injuries where bones have been broken or damaged. I had an earlier neck injury and compression fractures in my spine. I believe these old injuries were antagonized by the Boniva. ,In order to counteract the side effects I took Benadryl for a possible allergic reaction and Prednisone to reduce inflammation. Had to take 2 Tylenol every 6 hours for pain. This drug has not had anywhere near enough testing. In the aftermath of my experience I have now heard for 4 seperate people that they know or heard of someone with a bad Boniva experience. This drug was once a solvent / cleaning product in industry. How on earth did it ever get fed to mammals to see the effect on bone loss / bone growth? I will never take it again; even if I wind up only 4 feet tall. It is a horrible drug.

The drug is supposed to reduce risk of breast cancer.,I was given one month's free sample of Evista by my doctor.  I took one 60 mg pill each morning with 600 mg Calcium with Vitamin D as directed by my doctor.  I also walk 30 minutes daily on my treadmill; again at my Dr.'s direction.  I refilled the presciption at a local discount "member's only" store and paid $106 for one month of the drug. I have since purchased the drug on line for about half the cost.  Once I receive it; I will resume taking the drug.  Looks like I'll have about a two week vacation.  Biggest concerns about taking this drug are blood clots and stroke.  You are not allowed to smoke and alcohol consumption needs to be kept to a low level because it's not good for the bones. Other lifestlye issues related to healthy bones are followed.  ,I was given one month's free sample of Evista by my doctor.

This particular drug has almost no side effects and has shown evidence in clinical testing to reduce the occurance of breast cancer.  The only side effects I had are leg cramps and apparently; only a very few women experience this condition.,cramps in lower legs.  I took a magnesium supplement and it reduced the effect.,It is expensive.  My health benefits are not very good; so it costs around $100.00 a month.

I had foot cramps; couldn't sleep real well. I had extreme hot flashes each day; however; those were tolerable. I am only praying that this will all go away.

I started out having a very bad sore throat; hoarse voice and cough.  Went to a RediClini and got on antibiotic.  Also went to see a Dr. 2 days later and was given a prednisone pack because I had chest congestion and by that time I had laryngitis plus shortness of breath.  I dealt with these symptoms for 2 weeks.  Cough and wheezing got better and then I realized the connection between getting all of these symptoms and the side effects.  Checked online and sure enough; all of them were listed so I called the Dr. and stopped the medicine.  Shortness of breath is better and my voice is getting somewhat better.  ,None.

This is the only reason I stopped taking the drug; because my hair is naturally very fine iin texture and the thinning was more noticable than if my hair was of a thicker texture.,Interestingly; if I took four 250mg doses per day; the drug was not as effective in treating my acne.

I do still occasionally have break outs; but they are usually less severe; shorter lasting; and confined to my face.,The main side effect I've had is irregular periods.  First it was annoying; not knowing when my period when come.  Then as my period became less frequent; it was actually kind of nice.  However; now I feel like about 15 or 20 days into my cycle I start to bloat like normal; but don;t start or get relief for about another thirty or so days.

NO PAIN...,THERE WERE NO NOTICABLE SIDE EFFECTS...SPIRALACTONE ACTS AS A WATER PILL SO THERE WAS AN INCREASE OF URINATION.  THATS ALL...,after two shots of cortisone to my knee; I had an mri done...this showed no problems yet the cortisone injections lasted only about four months.  My dr did not want to give additional injections and prescribed physical therapy; which I did; but it only aleviated the pain for a short time and never for an entire day.  My job requires me to be on my feet and I needed more relief.  I went to an internist (the first doctor was a bone and joint specialist) who prescribed spiralactone.  OK; I didnt have much faith in a water pill; but it worked and still continues to work.  I do not take many medications but I do make sure I never run out of this miracle.

Otherwise; none.,I've had mild cystic acne as long as I can remember. The only time I didn't was when I was on BC pills. Over the course of 7 years; I've taken doxycyline; minocin and Doryx; all which initially helped somewhat. From the beginning; I tried to get my dermatologists to address the hormonal angle. Seven years later; someone finally listened. A couple months ago I started on 75 mg once a day and have had no breakouts since. Not sure how long she'll keep me on this regimen.
patient,50,female,high blood pressure,none,no other drugs but on HRT,Atacand (Candesartan Cilexetil) ,Cardiovascular-Agents Cardiovascular-Agents,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,16mg  taken once a day for the period of 2 years,lowered blood pressure ,I did experience some bowel changes although the doctor did not seem to think that this would be the result of the drug. I do; however. I experienced constipation.,One 16 mg tablet to be taken daily. I had been given other blood pressure medication previously which I did not respond as well to so It took a few tries to get it right. I would like to be able to stop taking the medication and am trying to lose weight and lead a healthier lifestyle but all the literature seems to suggest that I may always need to take the medication.
patient,49,male,Hypertension (High Blood Pressure),None,None,Atacand (Candesartan Cilexetil) ,Cardiovascular-Agents Cardiovascular-Agents,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,8mg  taken one  every morning for the period of One month,Effectively lowers blood pressure with very few side effects and NO cough; No drowsiness and no sexual problems of any kind!!!,I have had some very mild side effects. Slight nasal congestion (now gone) and an occasional sort of gravelly coarseness to my voice. If they are the only side effects then I am happy to live with that.,drug is by far the best I have tried so far and just one 8mg tablet a day does the trick for me!
patient,52,female,high blood pressure,atrial septal defect,premarin,Atacand (Candesartan Cilexetil) ,Cardiovascular-Agents Cardiovascular-Agents,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,16 mg  taken once a day for the period of still on it; but only 8 mg/day,The dizziness subsided; the auras appeared a lot more infrequently,tiredness,After my cardiac procedure; I ended up with high blood pressure because my body was not sure how to deal with the change in my system.  Where the blood was flowing from one atrium to the other was now closed and I was feeling so dizzy I had to look down at the ground to walk.  I couldn't drive. I went to my doctor several times to try and find out what the trouble was.  I monitered my blood pressure several times a day and was put on Atacand which seemed to work well.  However; I found it made me so tired; that I took half a pill in the morning and half at night. Now my body has adjusted a lot; I am only on half the dose I started with. I also take a baby aspirin daily. I rely on Atacand to keep my blood pressure stable.  Once in a while; if I start to feel dizzy or get an aura I take 1/2 a pill of Atacand and sit down for a bit and my symptons soon go away.
patient,73,male,high blood pressure,none,vitamins; folic acid; vit-D3,Atacand (Candesartan Cilexetil) ,Cardiovascular-Agents Cardiovascular-Agents,9,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,8 mg  taken once per day for the period of several years,The Atacand worked well for me IF taken consistently without skipping days.  I was able to bring my blood pressure to at least 120/80 and at times a bit lower.  Note that consistency of medication is a key.  Should the 8mg tablet taken once per day not prove as effective as desired; my physician advised that I could take an additional tablet or two per day without problem.,Did not notice any undesirable side effects.  The only thing that could be mentioned is that if one embarks on a significant exercise routine such as elleptical stairstep machine for 30+ minutes/day and keeps up the exercise for weeks on end while at the same time taking the Atacand; one may end up with a [not undesirable] blood pressure in the 112/65 range.  ,The Atacand worked well IF taken routinely without skipping days.  It takes a while for the regulation to start; ie; you can't begin from scratch taking the Atacand the first morning and expect proper blood pressure regulation that afternoon.  Doesn't work that quickly.  There is a tendency; after taking the medication consistently and seeing your pressure get well under control; to think that maybe you can stop or at least taper off of the Atacand.  One may try this but will find that the best regimen is consistency.  It did work well for me and keeps me under 120/80.
patient,62,male,high total cholesterol,barrets syndrome; mild situational depression,Nexium;  Wellbutrin,Niaspan (Niacin Extended-Release) ,Cardiovascular-Agents Cardiovascular-Agents,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,2000mg/day  taken once a day for the period of 3 years,The medication reduced total cholesterol from about 220 to about 180.  blood pressure appeared to slightly decrease from 125/70 to 115/65. The ration between high density cholesterol (good cholesterol) to low density cholesterol improved significantly.,Initially has hot flashes  red flushing of skin.  However it was discovered that taking the Niaspan before going to bed; with an 81mg enteric coated aspirin entirely eliminated the hot flashes.  There have been some deposits of fatty nodules just below the skin in several locations.  There has not been a causative link between the Niaspan pointed out to me. However since the Niaspan  reduces the circulating amount of a fatty chemical; the appearance of fatty deposits is suspicious.,is suggested that no high fat-foods be eaten several hours before taking the Niaspan; since there appears to be some relationship between high fat meals and hot flashes.
patient,55,female,high lpa,high cholesterol,lipitor,Niaspan (Niacin Extended-Release) ,Cardiovascular-Agents Cardiovascular-Agents,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1000 mg  taken once a day for the period of two years,Niaspan definitely works to lower lpa.  I understand that high lpa cause plaque build up in the arteries.  According to my cardiologist; high levels of lpa cause "skinny people to have heart attacks".  My levels were in the 70's and the normal range ends at 30.  After taking Niaspan for a few weeks; my lpa was within normal limits.,Flushing with skin burning was the main side effect of taking 1000 mg of Niapsan per day.  The cardiologist suggested taking a baby aspirin one halp hour before taking the Niaspan.  This does eliminate most of the flushing side effects and skin burning.  I highly recommend everyone with a family history of heart problems to get a blood test for lpa.,1000 mg a day - once a day  Cardiologist wanted me to take up to 1;500 mg but 1;000 mg brought my lpa back into range.  My blood lpa test came back in the 70 range and normal limit is up to 30.  After taking 1000 mg; I was back in the normal lpa range.  Everyone with a family history of heart attacks or high cholesterol should have an lpa blood test run in order to prevent possible plaque buildup.

From 230 to about 170.  The ratio was excellent.  This effect has consistently been monitored and remains steady.,There was some mild flushing feelings;  without flushed skin.  If the medicine was not taken with food there was an uncomfortable feeling in the stomach about three hours after ingestion.,was offered Lipitor; but refused.  A couple of years later I ended up with a bypass;  but without a heart attack.

I feel the niaspan has helped my hdl blood count considerable.

patient,45,male,hyperlipidemia,cluster headaches; gall bladder sludge/polyps,verapamil (for cluster headache prophylaxis); ursodiol (to mobilize gall bladder sludge),Niaspan (Niacin Extended-Release) ,Cardiovascular-Agents Cardiovascular-Agents,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,1000 mg  taken once per day for the period of 2 months,My total serum cholesterol dropped from 280 to 198; LDL dropped from 225 to 122; HDL increased from 38 to 57. My triglycerides were already low due to a strict low-carb diet. My blood pressure was already low (104/70) due to verapamil therapy to prevent cluster headaches; and has remained low. I experienced no serum increases in liver enzymes; urea; or sugar.,I experience regular mild flushing; along with mild itching of ears and arms. These effects occur within an hour of dosage; and subside after 20-30 minutes. I do not take aspirin or NSAIDs; nor avoid fatty foods with the medication; as is recommended to reduce the flushing and itching.,lbs over the last six months.
patient,37,female,Cholesterol problems,crohn's disease,mercaptopurine,Niaspan (Niacin Extended-Release) ,Cardiovascular-Agents Cardiovascular-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,1000 mg  taken every evening for the period of 4+years,My cholesterol levels were terrible.  I was around 32 years old with; as the doctor said; "the cholesterol of a 40 year old man."  It may have been partly due to my crohn's disease (which was flaring) and the weird way my body was absorbing nutrients at the time. Over the past 4 years my HDL levels have been significantly higher; and my overall cholesterol has moved into the acceptable zone (though not as good as I wish it was)!,Niaspan is a high dose of Niacin (vitamin B) and causes a good amount of flushing at a dose of 1000mg.  My cholesterol levels were screwy; and I had a more holistic doctor at the time.  She wanted to avoid drugs that she considered more harsh.  I was instructed to take the dose right before I went to bed.  I took the first dose about an hour before bed; and I turned beet red with the most amazing full-body flush.  Skin on my arms; torso; chest; neck and face was flushed.  I was really hot and really uncomfortable.  I went to lay down and try to sleep; but I couldn't get comfortable.  It was embarrassing because we had a guest staying with us at the time!  After about 15-20 minutes the flush subsided; and I was able to fall asleep.  So it is important to literally take the pill as you're getting into bed.  I've noticed some flushing sort of subconsciously while I'm asleep; but it generally doesn't wake me up.,I started with 1000mg and stayed at that level for about 2 years.  Then; after I moved and changed doctors; my dose was reduced to 500mg/night.  My liver stats were being monitored because of another medication I was taking (mercaptopurine); so I'm relatively sure I haven't had any adverse liver effects with this drug.
patient,38,male,choloesterol,htn,ramipril; lovasa; asa,Niaspan (Niacin Extended-Release) ,Cardiovascular-Agents Cardiovascular-Agents,3,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,2000 mg  taken daily for the period of 2 weeks,Initially; I was started on Niaspan 500 milligrams two times a day to lower my trigylcerides.  My level was over two thousand.  After three months; I went back to my primary care physician for follow-up blood work to check how I am responding to the treatment.  My trigyceride levels improved significantly but was not within normal limits. My triglyceride level was 503.  ,The side effect I experienced was moderate enough for me to contact my physician to ask for it to be changed.  My doctor told me to increase the dosage of Niaspan ER to two thousand milligrams every night.  For the first few days; I felt hot during the night and sweaty.  It was very uncomfortable; even if I had the airconditioning on.  After several days; I started having muscle pains on both my legs.  I was losing sleep becasue I was so uncomfortable and could no longer tolerate taking the medicine.  My physician then gave me the option of trying a new medication; or sticking to Niaspan ER but at a reduced dose.  I chose to stay with the same drug but at a reduced dose.  I now taker 1500 milligrams daily and do not feel any side effects.  I still need to go back to my doctor to see how this change affected my Triglycerides.,Niaspan ER 500mg twice a day was changed to Niaspan ER 2;000 mg every night; then changed to Niaspan ER 1500 mg every night.

Left ankle swells.  Feels like a lump or obstruction in throat.  Chest discomfort.  Shortness of breath at times.  ,Started at 500mg with most of the symptoms; increased to 1000mg and developed constant itching and skin disorders
patient,57,female,sleep disorders,none,Ritalin; Mirapex; C-PAP machine,Xyrem (Sodium Oxybate) ,Central-Nervous-System-Depressants Central-Nervous-System-Depressants,3,Marginally Effective,Mild Side Effects,400 mg  taken nightly; 2 does for the period of one week,I ahve three sleep disorders: sleep apnea due to closing up of my throat (anatomical); restless leg syndrome and the worst one; hypersomnia -- tired much of the time with no explanation. I tried this drug - sent directly to the home and only with approved diagnosis (I am just short of narcolepsy) - to see if I would feel rested when I awoke. I did for one day but then the effects did not continue with each successive night. Sounds strange; I know; but that is what happened.,I did not have any side effects except that if I got less than 4 1/2 hours of sleep after waking to take the second dose - I would stillfeel the effects -- as if drugged a bit.,I think I have included everything above. I tried a second week and felt a slight refreshed feeling upon awakening - but not significant ewnough to keep taking it. Understand; I only remember awakening refreshed 3 times in my life. one of them after that first night I used Xyrem. I have enough to try a third week and probably will -- since I am desperate for my former qualilty of life when I didn't struggle with feeling tired as I do now.
patient,34,female,insomnia,bipolar disorder,prozac; seroquel; lamictal; topamax; trileptal,Xyrem (Sodium Oxybate) ,Central-Nervous-System-Depressants Central-Nervous-System-Depressants,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,3mg  taken daily for the period of 6 months,While taking Xyrem; I slept exceptionally well at night; woke up rested; and strangely; within months of starting the medication; lost fifteen or more pounds.  ,Some nights I felt significant joint pain; primarily in my elbows and my shoulders.  Other nights I suffered night sweats so severe that I would have to change out of my wet pajamas.  On occasion when falling asleep I would feel very giddy; almost "high."  ,Lack of sleep severely impacts my mood and none of the other sedative medications that I had tried worked; so I tried xyrem with beneficial effects. 
patient,26,female,Fibromyalgia,Chronic Fatigue syndrome,none,Xyrem (Sodium Oxybate) ,Central-Nervous-System-Depressants Central-Nervous-System-Depressants,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,6 grams divided into 2 doses  (dosage frequency: twice at night 2.50- 4  hrs apart)  for the period of 1 year,For the first time in years I woke up without widespread flu like pain throughout my body. I woke up feeling rested; awake; alert. Some days were still worse than others; but overall a dramatic difference. I could function throughout the day; wasn't almost falling asleep all the time. If work got crazy and I had to pull 14-16 hrs - which was quite frequent - I didn't get immediately sick.  I actually flew on planes multiple times without getting sick. I used to blink and get sick because my system was so run down despite many hours of sleep a night. When I take xyrem I need only 6-8 hours of sleep and I would wake up and feel great throughout the day. It was an absolute lifesaver for me. ,I had a moderate number of side effects that were bothersome but not serious: Oily skin and hair; acne was worse in the beginning; excessive night time sweating - i would wake up drenched every night; acid reflux - this was on and off - tension and anxiety was increased during waking hours. I had teeth sensitivety that developed after starting the drug; rapid pulse (this was weird but it was never a bother); I lost a few lbs and I could eat whatever and not gain much weight. My testosterone levels went way high - not high enough to turn into a boy; but high enough to grow more body hair in places I didn't want and had some hair loss at the temples. I also had problems with short term memory; though I did before when I was in a fibro-fog too. So off the medicine I have a heck of a time still because it is back to fibro fog.  It is a shame because i used to have a great memory. ,I would take 3 gms before bed. Wake up 2.50 to 4 hrs later for second dose.  It was easy to wake up; many times I would wake up on my own. Sometimes I would try to wake up too early and would just sleep through my alarm and then wake up closer to the 4 hr mark. If I didn't have a busy job it would just be ideal to try to get closer to 8 or more hrs of sleep every night. That was not always practical for me. I started off at the 3 gms dose twice per night and never had to change. Sometimes; depending on the time of month I got less sleep with the dose - i would awake after only 2.5 hrs later and get around 5 hrs of sleep a night. Depending on where it was with my cycle; sometimes I couldn't wake up so I would lessen my second dose to 2.25 gms so I could wake up at 4 hrs after the dose. 
patient,35,female,Narcolepsy,Depression/anxiety,Zoloft; Provigil,Xyrem (Sodium Oxybate) ,Central-Nervous-System-Depressants Central-Nervous-System-Depressants,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,3 ml and 4.5 ml  (dosage frequency: 2x)  for the period of One year,Xyrem has been life-changing for me and more than I could have ever hoped for.  I spent most of my life completely exhausted and desperately tired.  The worst part was; I always just thought I was lazy.  Even after I was diagnosed; and was on Provigil (I was taking Provigil only for years before Xyrem)I still questioned if I really had a sleep disorder and thought that perhaps I was just lazier than everyone else.  Now that I take Xyrem; I know that I really do have a sleep disorder because Xyrem has changed my life so much.  I could have never imagined how much better and easier life is with a good nights sleep.  Without Xyrem; I spend most too much time in REM sleep.  I would dream constantly; beginning almost immediately after I would fall asleep.  Almost every morning I would wake up and still be in a dream.  Xyrem forces me into NREM sleep and it has made all the difference for me. ,Im sure it causes night sweats and significant weight loss.  Other side effects that may or may not be related that I experience (although I also started taking it after the birth of my first child and may be related to that rather than the Xyrem)were receeding hairline; short term memory impact; some decrease in cognitive function such as difficulty with word recall; following a more complex line of reasoning; etc..; and increased anxiety.  Even given the side effects; my life is so much better now that I am not so exhausted and I can't imagine going back to life before Xyrem.,1 dose right before bed and another 3-4 hours later.

Getting unrefreshed sleep every other night,I have been taking Xyrem for about 2 months. I sleep about 5 to 5 1/2 hours every night. I wake up between 3 to 3 1/2 hour after the 1st dose and then I sleep for about 2 to 2 1/2 hours after the 2nd dose and am unable to fall asleep. The weirdest thing is that I get a refreshing sleep every other day. On the days that I wake up exhausted; I am barely able to make it through the day and am hungry all the time. The next night; I usually sleep well and have a better day there after. I am going to stop taking it and I am going to explore other options such as Rozerem or Trazodone

I had vivid hallucinations and I had to control my emotions.I would also get up to use the restroom approximately 10 times at night. Since i started taking Xyrem; I stopped taking those daily naps; no more hallucinations and I am able to laugh;cry more with less muscle weakness. Eventhough I only sleep for 6-7 hours max; I wake up feeling refreshed.,When I take the first dose I noticed that I dont have trouble falling asleep. When I take my second dose 3-4 hours later;I am super dizzy. If I need to use the restroom I have to hold on and hurry back to bed.  ,I take my first dose (3.0 g) around 11 pm. take second dose around 3 am. I wake up like around 6 am. I want to stay in bed for more but cant. I am not sleepy. There are mornings were I am still feeling groggy; and by noon i would be okay to do my daily chores.

It has helped with the feeling of not sleeping at all when I would wake up the next morning. However; if you do not get into bed and STAY for about 3 hours you can fall and do things you don't even realize you are doing. I got up to use the bathroom a few times on this medication and once I fell into the bathtub and also have fallen asleep on toilet if I have gotten up to use the bathroom. It can take affect VERY quickly if you have an empty stomach. There was a time I thought I had at least 15 minutes before it put me to sleep but I hadn't eaten much and it kicked in in 5 minutes. I fell asleep talking to my Fiance. It literally knocks you out like when you are put under anesthesia for surgery. It can be very dangerous but it is quite affective for helping you sleep and go into the refreshing cycles of sleep.

Loss of fat; increase in muscle size and strength. Improved energy. Improved interaction with friends and family.,During the first 2 weeks there was stomach irritation; increased sweating at night; and diminished appetite.  All have abated now.,the exception of the outrageous price; Xyrem is an amazing treatment for insomnia.

Also; while taking the drug; I noted a significant decrease in my appetite; which subsequently induced a fair amount of weight loss. ,I experienced heightened levels of sleeplessness while on the medication. In addition; I was constantly concerned about my ability to study and perform while not on the medication. While this is not a physical side effect; it is a very real emotional one that caused me some stress.,After noticing that I was having difficulty being attentive during my high school classes; experiencing an inability to sustain focus on one thing at a time; and was unable to finish assignments on time due to these two symptoms; I decided to see my doctor. He asked me a variety of questions about my current state and the problems I was having; and after listening; prescribed a small dosage of Adderall to alleviate these issues. After taking the first dose; my concentration increased ten-fold. As a result; my grades went up. I discontinued my use of Adderall upon my college graduation; and have found that while I still suffer from symptoms of attention deficit disorder; it is having a decreased effect on my adult life.

I found this to cause some 'nervousness' and to have peaks & valleys. I switched to Adderall XR and find I notice no physical symptoms; only an increase in positive mood and desire to accomplish the days work. The effect does seem to peak soon after the dose; slowly level out; and at about 6-8 hrs. after initial dose; I feel calm but now enthusiastic as earlier in the day.

Able to follow through with hobbies and interests as well as work.  Before treatment; memory was nonexistent. After treatment not only could I remember things but time itself changed.  Time seemed to move faster.  The body; down to a cellular level; processes toxins faster so skin becomes clear and perfect.,Hair loss. Hyperthyroid at first then Hypothyroid. The initial weight loss is pretty cool but over time can lead to malnourishment.  Have to be careful not to fall into a "manic" mode because it is totally annoying to others.  Also it tends to cause tension in my back.  I've spent much money at the chiropractor over the years.  Otherwise the pain is unbearable.,This medicine changed my life; but there are still spin off's of ADD; like the auditory processing; anxiety and emotional control and general sensitivity that have to be dealt with.  Not to mention health issues like making sure to get enough vitamins (kelp levels out my thyroid pretty well); and picking up a prescription from the doctor every 30 days.  I take 15 mgs AM and 15 after lunch.  Can't take it too late in the day or will cause sleeplessness.

Before my diagnosis of adult ADD; I had a very difficult time focusing and staying on task.  I also experienced "hyper-focusing"; which prevented me from getting things done at work in a timely manner.  It has also helped improved my memory.,I didn't notice any side effects from Adderall.  However; it is metabolized very quickly and only stays effective for about 3 to 4 hours.  Forgetting to take the second dose around 1:00pm makes for a confusing afternoon; until I remember to take it.,My prescriber and I went through about 3 different medications before Adderall; and those did have unpleasant side effects such as sweaty palms (all the time); dizziness; and heart palpitations.  Once I found that Adderall didn't cause side effects for me; we gradually increased the dosage from 5 mg to 10mg and then back down to 7.5 mg which works best for me.

I definitely function better while taking it.  I am prescribed to take it "as needed" which means that I don't take it everyday.  I tend to take it most school days (med school) and take more of it during testing times.  I am prescribed to take it up to 3 times a day; but I rarely have taken that much.  ,If I take a 5 mg pill later than 3 pm or so it is difficult to fall asleep.  I sometimes get jittery or feel like my heart is racing.  Sometimes I have strange muscle twitches that I can't control.  Some days it makes me lose my appetite completely; which doesn't sound bad but I'm already a little underweight.,Since I control when I take the meds (what time; how much- up to 3 per day) I think I have over-done it on occasion; even though it was never above what I'm perscribed.  Some days I will take 3 pills so I can truly concentrate; and then can't sleep. . . may have to take a sleeping pill. . . wake up feeling awful and groggy. . . and have to do the whole viscious cycle all over again.  So; even though I'm doing what I'm perscribed to do; it can be too much for me.  I can understand why there is abuse potential with this drug; as you start feeling dependent on it.  Even with all that; the drug has helped me out more than I can ever explain.

Adderall increased my overall energy levels; making it easier to get going in the morning and stay awake during classes. It increased my ability to pay attention even when the material was not particularly interesting to me. The most important benefit for me was the increased ability to control my impulses. ,If taken too late in the day; it can interfere with sleep. It must be carefully controlled as it is addictive. The main side effect I have experienced though was pathological skin picking. I mainly pick at my legs; but the picking sometimes leaves small scars. It also decreases appetite; which means patients must learn new ways to remember to eat or to identify the need to eat. It can also increase blood pressure slightly.,Adderall was taken once in the morning every day. This medication was combined with cognitive behavioral therapy once a week. Within the last year; neurofeedback (biofeedback to control brainwave patterns) was added. This treatment has been very effective; and will be continued as long as it is needed.

By taking this med; it caused a chain reaction that got my life moving forward again: I started by becoming able to get out of bed and get things done around the house. Had more motivation to help myself in other ways - better nutrition; better exercise; self care; etc. Then my body and mind began to kick in and heal itself more. Now the med simply acts as a support for me; but I am ready to start tapering down my dose!!!,Had trouble losing too much weight at first. But that levels off after a while. Had problems sleeping when the dose was increased too quickly. I have to make sure I take the full amount for the day at least before 12 noon or I will have trouble sleeping that night.

To releave sudden impulsive behavor.  To help me focus on things that I had to do.  To help me retain information that I was studing in school.  To help me stop putting things off that were important for me to finish.  To help improve my relationships.,I found that some of the side effects were very severe.  I would have compulsive sexual desires that I had never had before and wanted sex with my husband all the time.  I had great difficulty sleeping so I would take melatonin to go to sleep every night.  I would talk very fast as well as move fast.  I would have hand tremers.  I also had very dry mouth and diarrhea.,I woke up every morning a took 1 20mg tab with a full glass of water.  Then; throughout the day I would have to make myself drink water and eat.  I had lost all desire to eat or drink until around 8 or 9pm that day.  I would have obsessive thoughts and couldn't stop working on something until it was finished.  This meant even if I really needed to stop and do something else I couldn't.  I called my doctor and explained this and he switched me to adderall 10mg without extended release.  This has been much better.  However; I still have some obsessive behavor.  I have never been dx or tx for OCD.

I felt a calm and order to my life and work. I was truly able to focus on important things that I needed to do and did so efficiently; which was something I was never able to do. Menopause exacerbated the extreme mental fuzziness that I had already been experiencing with 4 children and a more than full time job. This drug has truly changed my life for the better!,I did not experience any side effects that were negative. I could hear better and think in a focused way within a short amount of time (30-45 minutes after taking the drug) ,I take a 30 mg. pill shortly after waking and within an hour; the fog that I chronically have had all of my life just lifts!

patient,35,female,ADD management,None,Prozac 3 months after being on adderall,Adderall XR ,Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Dopamine-Agents Dopamine-Uptake-Inhibitors Sympathomimetics,7,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,25 MG  taken daily for the period of 5 months,This does actually help calm you down and help you concentrate. My grades went upby a lot. I was calm and was doing much better on it (much better reffering to the ADD treatment) but there are so many negative side effects. In a way I regret ever taking it. ,I developed an anorexia; I stopped eating and lost so much weight. I'm about 5ft. 6 now and weigh about 130 LBS. which is really skinny for my age and height. If I wouldn't have stopped I would be skin and bones. I got to a point where I lost color and I'm now way too skinny. Another side effect that I developed is insomnia. I have a VERY hard time sleeping. I can't fall asleep until about 1:00 and that's every night. It's horrible. Another side effect that's very serious; is development of depression. I had to go on anti-depressants because of the drug about 3 months after using adderall. It depresses you so much. After school I'd get home and be so depressed. I'd cry and just feel so misserable. I was seriously depressed. A fact that everyone should understand about adderall is that it's in a way a wattered down version of meth. The side effects are the same but not as severe. But it's still bad. It will mess up your teeth by giving you a VERY dry mouth; your weight and most of all your brain chemistry. I went from ADD to depression to now ADHD. I'm going back on stimulant drugs like adderall when school starts. I don't know how it'll work out because I now have a tolerance to it. And I'm getting new treatment. I don't know what'll happen or anything. But I just wantto get through school. Anyone that will be perscribbed to this should research on it and get the facts. Research for a long time. Not just one article reading. Get as much info as possible. The side effects are so severe that you should really know what you're exposing yourself to. They're all horrible. Especially the addiction that you get to it. I'm addicted to it and can't stop craving it. I feel like I need it so bad. It's been months and still I want it extremely bad. Be careful what choice you make. It gets the job done. Hut will screw up your life. This is just my experience. It may be different for you but still do your research.,I was on 20 MGS for a while then went up to 40 then more and went back down to 25.

Just an inability to focus; hyperactivity; and impulsive behavior.  I had a hard time staying organized and difficulty completing tasks.  I also had difficulty staying with one job for too long.  I had a hard time sustaining reading without getting really tired; and I also had a hard time controlling my emotional outbursts.  The  Concerta really helped me control all of those things.,Some of the side affects that I had were:  my stomach would hurt sometimes and other times it was difficult to eat without getting queezy.  I didn't have much of an appetite.  When the medicine wore off; it seemed to have a strong rebound effect and things became difficult for me during that last several hours of my day. I liked taking the medication; I just wish it would have lasted longer during the day.  By 3p-5pm it had wore off and that seemed to by my busiest time of day with the kids; dinner and house stuff all at once. ,The treatment details were pretty basic.  I just took the medication in the morning at the same time of day every day.  I was allowed to skip it on the weekends or less busy times if I so desired.  I really don't have anything else to put for this section of the survey.  I'm trying to fill up the 50 word requirement though.  You shouldn't really have that requirement on this form.

I also remember extremely vivid dreams. The house was kept super clean and I was motivated to finish tasks. ,Horrible feeling. My heart felt like it would explode. I had horrible tic like behavior. I picked at my skin until permanently damaged. I had horrible dry mouth and I had bad breath.,the doctor that prescribed this to me was investigated; tried and convicted of over prescribing; drug dealing and improper relationships with patients.

I used to sleep 12-16 hours per day and was always tired and fatigued when awake.  I was diagnosed with sleep apnea 5 years ago; but even sleeping with CPAP did not help with my daytime fatigue.  After seeing MANY family practitioners; I finally broke down and INVESTED in a very well educated Psychiatrist who diagnoed me with ADD since childhood.  His decision to prescribe Vyvanse was brilliant!  I feel better than ever and am totally clear headed and able to consentrate.  For the first time in as long as I can remember; I can think normally!  No more racing thoughts in my head; and my depression and anxiety has all but vanashed!  I do still take an antidepressive; but I am CERTAIN that the Vyvanse gave the antidepression meds the ability to work.  I can FINALLY sleep a normal 7 to 9 hours and still be awake and alert throughout my 12-hour work days.  I was worried that the Vyvanse would elevate my anxiety level; but the opposite occured!  My anxiety is all but absent; and I no longer have the need to continue with my anti-anxiety meds!  There is NO SUBSTITUTE for a Doctor who is a specialist in mental health.  Spend the money and see!  A good Psychiatrist will spend HOURS with you before making a diagnosis; and if Adult ADD is what you have; then give Vyvanse a try.  It worked GREAT for me and my live has turned around for the better.  It is the best remedy that I have found in 15 years!  You MUST take it when you awaken for your day; because it takes about 12-15 hours to get out of your system.  If you take it later in the day - you will experaince insomnia.  Ask your SPECIALIST about Vyvanse...  
patient,27,male,ADD,Depression,Lexapro,Dextroamphetamine ,Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,10mg   taken 4 times daily for the period of 2 months,Smoother more gradual onset and effect than Adderall. Effective at controlling ADD symptoms previously controlled by Adderall however this drug seems more natural and transparent. Less tension and anxiety. Less "druggy" unnatural feelings and thoughts.,Dexerine IR tablets need to be taken more often than adderall and also wear off more abruptly. Generic tablets are not high quality and somewhat expensive due to the need for a large quantity of tablets. ,Switched from Adderall to Dexedrine to compare the effects. Dexedrine is simply dextroamphetamine while Adderall is a mixture of Amphetamine salts. This might explain the increased effectiveness of the Dexedrine contrary to popular belief. I found it important to take several relatively low doses frequently to achieve a balanced effect.

Helps to keep me from being hyperactive and fidgety and helps with memory to an extent.,If I am stressed; I seem to be jittery and the benefits are not as prominent. ,I was diagnosed with ADD three years ago. Have tried several different prescriptions and found the best results from Adderall and Vyvanse.

When taking adderall xr 20mg; I had a lot of side effects ranging from dry mouth to aggressive behavior. I was very irritable with adderall xr; but with Vyvanse I am not irritable at all as a symptom of the drug. I focus and concentrate much better; and for much longer; I have no symptoms. I feel more calm and more happy on Vyvanse. ,The only negative side effect was the insomnia for the first few weeks; but that is to be expected from this type of drug I believe.,Vyvanse 50mg taken once daily in the morning.

Easy to take; just one pill a day! ,I had no side effects with this drug!  I loved it.,Vyvanse is a new medication used to treat ADHD.  It is a time-released capsule.  It is easy to swallow (no bad taste like pressed pills); and does not upset your stomach.  I took one 70mg pill in the morning.  The pill releases the drug slowly; so ur not hit with all of it at one time.  This allows for the medicine to be equally effective all day; not just for a few hours. I did NOT have any of the normal ADHD med. side effects; such as: rapid heart rate; anxiety; jittery feeling.  The only downside to this medication is the cost.  Since Vyvanse is new; there is no generic for it.  I paid $160/month for 30 pills! I was self-pay though; so I'm sure having insurance would be ideal! Although it is very expensive; it is well worth it.

If I don't remind myself to eat I don't get hungry at all.  The couple of times I forgot to eat; I never felt any feeling of hunger.  I just felt spacey and tired and couldn't figure out why.  Then I realized that it was 3:00 and forgot to eat or drink all day.  I have to set an alarm to remind myself that it's time to eat.,One pill daily as soon as I wake up.

It is highly effective without the severe side effects of comparable medications to treat the same condition. Also; it does not destroy my appetite and I feel healthier with particular medication. I don ,Appetite is reduced; but not to an un-healthy degree. Smaller portions at both meal time and snack time are all that you can manage during the day. However; in my experience I eat normal dinner portions. In fact; I feel that with this medication I am eating ample; healthy portions for my gender; body-type and build.  It should be noted that with this and other medications like it you are often so focused it is easy to forget to eat; but it will catch up with you later in the day. You will want the portions you should have had; but no longer have the hours left to spread them out. I set a timer to remind me it ,I take this medication once each morning and it lasts throughout the day and into the early evening. With this medication you must see your provider every six months to evaluate weight changes and effectiveness. During the 2 checks that I have had my weight has been consistent. Luckily; dosage has not been modified; we started out with the correct dosage. Although; from what I understand that is rare; dosages often have to be modified to find what works best for each individual.

School and work performace improved. I have more drive to be productive. I also find that I am much more friendly; talkative; and social. I find myself wanting to talk to my family and catch up with friends. I also have mild depression; and since starting vyvanse I was able to come off Wellbutrin because the Vyvanse gave me a very happy feeling in a natural way. The feeling is only slightly "euphoric". This medication makes me feel like a normal person should feel.,Decreased appetite. I have lost 20 pounds over the past six months. I eat one or two small snacks during the day; but at night I will have a meal when the medication begins to wear off. I also drink alot more fluids due to the dry mouth; which is another side effect. Neither of these side effects are bothersome though. I could afford to lose an additional 20 pounds and i'm hoping vyvanse can help me with that. I used to OVER eat; and now i eat only when my body needs the energy; which is good.,overall I would definitely suggest vyvanse if you are unhappy with your current ADD meds; or if you are thinking about seeing a doctor concerning ADD. I will say that if you are your child is under 18; or irresponsible concerning "drugs" be careful and keep an eye on your childs consumption. Even though they say vyvanse is non-addicting; the feeling while on it and the persona it gives is very much desireable in comparison to not taking it. Also; if you are already under weight you should try a natural stimulant like stratera instead.

Vyvanse not only helps me focus and take away the symptoms of ADHD that I was experiencing; but it does so for about 12 hours.  With Adderall XR; the effects lasted only a few hours; and I experienced a crash after the effects wore off and I instantly because extremely cranky and irratable.  With Adderall XR; I also lost the desire to eat.  I am hungry with Vyvanse; and do have the desire to eat.  With Vyvanse; I do not feel the crash at the end of the day; and I do not experience any moodiness.  I am very please with this drug; and it has changed my life for the better.  I have reccommended it to other family members with the same problems that I have and they have shared with me similar success stories.,The only side effect I experience is times of having a slightly dry mouth.  The dry mouth I experienced with Adderall was much worse.  ,I take one 70mg pill a day in the morning. I don't take it with food and it does not bother my stomach at all.

Granted; my dose was low; but I had a hard time concentrating and summoning up the energy to do basic things like paying bills; etc. Vyvanse is no wonder drug; but I live pretty much like everyone else now; which is great. My mother is stunned. She says this is the first time she's ever been able to ask me where things are in my apartment and have me know (and be right). I take a medication holiday from Vyvanse most weekends and actual work holidays when I don't need to be able to concentrate.,A little bit of sleeplessness at first. I take Vyvanse in the morning at around 5:30 to fix this. I just set my alarm; take the pill with a glass of water; and go back to sleep for an hour. I then wake up around 7 without any problems.,1 pill; 30 mg; Vyvanse; as needed. I never take more than the prescribed amount (not trying to get addicted; here).

Also; I think finding the right dose had a lot to do with that.  Because I could easily split the pills I was able to take a larger dose in the morning and a lesser mid-morning and not have a big drop at the end of the day.

Concerta did nothing for me either; and as an adult; vyvanse was the first ADHD drug I was put on since I was in elementary school. I've been on 50 mg; 70 mg; and 60 mg. 60 works best for me; lasting about 7 hours. 70 mg kept me from being able to fall asleep and 50 mg only lasted about 5.5-6 hours. I am able to pay attention and absorb the information in my classes. I also found that vyvanse put me in a good mood for the day!

My grades improved dramatically; which was specifically the result I wanted. I now take 70 mg and intend to until graduating and taking the big test in Oct. '11. After that; I hope to stop taking it.

I switched to Vyvanse and the first time i took it; it was like an anti deppresant at first i was the normal happy hyper me but i could still focus very well on studying but when i started comming down from it that was the worst i was dry heaving with a TERRIBLE HEADACHE for an hour and then i would just throw everything up it made me very irritated i would twitch ALOT and my heart beat was fast and very heavy but after my second day my body started getting use to it and i havent had anymore problems with it.,throwing up alot; bad headaches; twitching; crazy heart beat; loss of appetite (which is a plus in my eyes); and happy thoughts (like "wow im soo beautiful" for some reason would pop in my head alot); as well as some negative thoughts and worrying about homework constantly which is fine to because i would get it all done.,So far the throwing up has stopped and the headaches come and go no food even looks good to eat no cravings very easy to diet ;) and passing all my finals was AMAZING.

When it came to school work though I found that I needed the 30mg to increase my level of focus (and have been on it for a month since).  I had not experienced decreased appetite until about a month into taking the 20mg.  I find that the greatest benefit of Vyvanse for me is that it tends to stabalize my mood on a daily basis and lessens any bouts of anxiety and depression that i used to face before I was perscribed.

I was always forgetful; but now after taking it a few days; I nearly never forget anything. And I remember the material covered in class.,Few side effects; BUT...the few that I did have were quite severe. The biggest and worst effect was the constant chewing; mostly without noticing. As I said before; I'm spontaneous. And my spontaneous self had decided to buy a pacifier shortly before my doctors appointment where I was prescribed Vyvanse. After taking the vyvanse;I felt the sudden urge to chew; on anything ane everything; including the pacifier; my fingers; my cell phone; and the worst; my cheeks. I could feel the pain of chewing my cheeks; and I could taste the blood; but I didn't know what caused it. I didn't know that I was chewing my cheeks at that point. By the end of that day; I had chewed both cheeks; my tongue; and the right side of my top lip quite badly. It also made me lose all intrest in eating; and I love to eat; and I need to eat. (85 lbs. 5'1") after school; I knew that I had to eat; and spent over 30 minutes eating a single cookie.,On 9/18/11 I was prescribed (30) 30mg Vyvanse for ADHD to take every morning. It had common side effects on me; such as loss of appetite; severe chewing; and I "geeked out" pretty bad. I'm not usually a very organised person; but shortly after school; I spent 5 hours cleaning.

It is a time-released capsule. It is easy to swallow (no bad taste like pressed pills); and does not upset your stomach. The pill releases the drug slowly; so ur not hit with all of it at one time. This allows for the medicine to be equally effective all day; not just for a few hours. Since Vyvanse is new; there is no generic for it.

In addition; appetite loss; dry mouth; and some stomach upset were also experienced.,I was originally prescribed 1 tablet bid and discovered that for me; reducing the dosage to 1/2 tablet worked much better. I am about 5'4" and weigh 140 lbs. I now use the medication only on an as needed basis rather than take it daily; which is not necessary as my energy levels vary quite a bit. It was also suggested that I try Flexoril (sp) to see if the cause for my fatigue was caused by pain or discomfort which kept me from getting adequate sleep. That was not effective unless I wanted to miss  a day from even more fatigue than usual.

Without it; the fatigue I experience due to MS overwhelms me and renders me pretty much useless.,The only side effect is increased wakefulness at night when I'd like to go to  sleep.,The neurologist who first diagnosed the MS prescribed Provigil in 2001. At first I took only 100 milligrams per day; but have gradually increased the dose in order to get the same effect I got initially. I've asked my doctors several times if the drug is addictive; and they say it is not supposed to be.

It didn't make me jittery. It just boosted my energy. It did give me considerable dry mouth. I did notice that I would be a little more tired if I didn't take it for a couple of days. I think it is mildly addictive. Overall; I gained more benefit from it than negatives. I did worry about blood pressure because it did seem to increase my heartrate. I would recommend it to those who suffer from mild depression and/or just need a little extra energy boost. The medication is actually to treat narcolepsy; a condition in which a patient falls asleep at random times and has trouble staying awake.,Dry mouth; mild addictive properties; slight increase in heart rate.,I took 1 tablet every morning. 100 mg. It was important to take it in the morning. If I took it at night; I would be up all night.

New pimples pop up all the time.,None.  Not that I can tell.,One dose a day.

PLEASE< PLEASE read on....,7 weeks on Provigil; with the last week having been increased from 200mg to 300mg per day; I awoke one morning in a highly delusional state; speaking of non-existent farm animals wandering around the kitchen table where my wife and I were seated. After apparently collapsing in my bedroom; I was taken to ER; which quickly determined that I was critically hypotensive (low blood pressure of 72/35). I quickly lapsed into cardiogenic shock; a condition where the heart all but stops pumping blood and one of the deadliest of all medical crises. Even among those who are still alive upon arrival at an ER;  70% to 80% die within hours or a few days. Those who survive likely do so; as I did; with kidneys in acute failure and brain damage similar to what is sustained by near-drowning victims who have been resuscitated by a lengthy CPR session.     ,ER doctor immediately paged the cardiologist on call. Arriving quickly; he assessed my condition and determined that my only chance of survival was a transport to a regional heart center 35 miles away. As he awaited the ambulance; he took me to my local hospital's heart catheterization lab; not to put a stent in; but to push a tiny balloon through  my femoral artery to a destination next to my aorta; after which a tiny battery powered air pump was used to inflate the balloon and keep it inflated. The balloon (called an intra-aortic balloon pump) works by temporarily filling the empty space around the heart; then applying continuous gentle pressure to my aorta in an effort to keep my blood pressure from additional falling past the small amount that would otherwise kill me. Arriving at the heart center I was unconscious and would lapse into a coma for 9 days; kept alive by mechanical ventilation through a tube inserted through my throat to my lungs ("I'm in"; the TV doctors always say when the get the insertion right).

Increased insomnia; loss of appetite; lost 18 pounds so far.,I take 200mg every morning. It keeps me from feeling tired; but doesn't help me feel rested. At night have to take a sleeping pill so that I actually fall asleep.

I could focus clearly; and if I needed a boost during the day another dose was enough. ,It may cause some nervousness or restlessness. Sometimes I felt like I had drank a large cup of coffee during its full potency. ,the morning after I would take a dose the effects were noticeble and even pronounced; however after about lunchtime it totally wore off and I would have to take another dose; but if the second pill is taken later in the day it sometimes would interfere with sleep so one must be carful to take the pill at the right time. 
patient,24,male,chronic fatigue ,None,None,Provigil (Modafinil) ,Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,6,Moderately Effective,No Side Effects,100 mg  taken once a day in the morning for the period of 3 months,Treatment benefits were noticeable but not substantial. I did not respond to 100mg a day as I or the doctor had hoped. But it did allow me to stay focused throughout the day with out drowsiness or fatigue; so I give it a positive review. Treatment effectiveness varies among individuals,nervousness; insomnia (if taken late in the day),cronic fatigue. 
patient,27,male,ADD,Depression,Wellbutrin,Provigil (Modafinil) ,Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,200mg   taken 1 daily for the period of 6 months,After adjusting to the medication; focus and alertness improved significantly.  Fatigue and trouble "becoming bored" disappeared and I was ablve to focus on school studies and work for the first time in many many years.  No stimulant effect was felt; but it even became fun to actually sit down on a couch and just read a book.,Mild headaches occasionally when the drug wore off; smelly urine; occasionally insomnia; depending on what time the drug was first taken.,Have tried Ritalin for ADD and while it worked the stimulant effect was disturbing and way too much.  Wellbutrin seemed to not do a thing; but after 1 week of taking provigil the effect was enourmously obvious.
patient,27,female,Bipolar Disorder with severe lows & fatigue;  ,Depression; eating disorder; modafinil; kidney stones & osteoperosis,Cymbalta,Provigil (Modafinil) ,Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Neuroprotective-Agents Neuroprotective-Agents,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,400 MG  taken 7:00 am  and 1:00pm for the period of 6 months and running,I do feel much more awake; but I still need a nap everyday even after taking both of my doses. With 8-10 hours of sleep I'm still very fatigued; but I am able to think more clearly...and even drive again. My mood is much better and seems to be more stable than before. The endless fatigue used to spin me out of control and send me into rage; and the only way that I could deal with the rage was to clean like mad crazy and put my focus on ANYTHING other than the real issues...all the while never eating or drinking anything for weeks at a time. From there I would become extremely manic and focus only on organization; my eating disorder and cleaning. This hasn't happened at all since taking provigal in combination with Cymbalta. I did read that this medication is not recommended for people with a history of mania; ocd or eating disorders....but I feel that it's been very effective in the long run for me.,Acne!!!!!!!!!! ACNE!!!!! I had a bit of anxiety when I first began taking it; but that has since gone away. My heart raced for a couple of weeks; but It's hard to tell if it really was the provigil simply because my heart often races at random. I had a bit of trouble sleeping the first 3 nights after taking provigil; but this hasn't been a problem AT ALL since. I have lost some weight that I had gained back just before starting provigil; and this has left my husband and therapist a little concerned; but I still get hungry and have not changed my diet...but the provigil IS the cause and I have no doubt about it. I did not refill it for three weeks earlier this year and gained nearly 10 pounds...so this drug would be fairly effective for weightloss.,My bipolar disorder is often at the lowest points more than the highest points anymore. In the past I switched moods much more rapidly and was given the diagnosis of Rapid cycling bipolar disorder. After my first daughter was born it only got worse. Weeks without any sleep! Then when my second daughter was born something changed within me. I couoldn't wake up at night to even hear her cry. My husband took vacation time to stay home to let me rest. I relapsed worse than ever with my eating disorder and required my 3rd feeding tube and I just could not function enough to even take care of myself; normal life or even my baby girls. I was go into fits of rage from the sheer exhaustion and would CLEAN FOR DAYS AND WEEKS without eating ; drinking; sleeping or even sitting! Then I would crash! Finally my doctor decided to jusy try provigil; and it has helped a great deal along with cymbalta. I'm not sure why becasue according the everything I know about both medications...they are completely wrong for me. However; nothing else has worked thu far. I have taken EVERYTHING! This has been a dream for me even if I don't have as much pep in my step as I would like....I'm not a blank; lifeless; useless zombie.

I like that the effects come on very subtly and they also go away in the same manner.  I don't like to feel like I need a prescription which has no other (yet) proven benefits in long term cognition; I hope to either find another supplement to do something similar or see some research which shows Provigil has many more benefits than it does drawbacks.,Sometimes the sensation of racing pulse.,200mg once a day.

I had learned to live eternally tired and able to fall asleep at a moment's notice.  After a sleep study revealed narcolepsy and I started on Provigil; I feel as if I've been given a second chance at life.  Provigil helps me to stay awake and be alert....I no longer feel fatigued and always wanting to sleep.  Provigil is an amazing drug and thank God it's available!!!!,none,400 mg every morning; 200 mg early afternoon.

It also indirectly boosts mood by allowing some level of function during a chronic illness where things can easily spiral downward.,There were no side affects until reached 600 mg / day.  This is above the normal dose but within dosing guidelines. ,It was a shot in the arm without any side affects. It is NOT a magic bullet but can provide some relief in a chronic situation.

My quality of life was pretty much non-existant as I didn't enjoy anthing because I was always too tired.  When I started provigil I quit feeling like I always needed a nap and was able to make plans with friends because I had the energy to do more than just get through 9 to 11 hour work days.  ,No negative side effects,Was prescribed 100 mg and could go up to 200 mg as needed.  On a regular day 100 mg was sufficient.  On long days or if I had activities schduled after work I would take another 100 mg tablet or I'd cut a tablet in half to take 50 mg rather than 100 .  I made sure I didn't take anymore after about 6:00 pm or it would keep me awake at night.

My neurologist suggested I try this.  It has helped considerably during the daytime with my concentration level and also has helped me to stay focused.       ,Provigil works well for an approximate 3 hr. period; but wears off shortly after that. I do experience slight rapid heartbeat initially and feel jittery for a short time but it goes away quickly. I currently take 100 mg. and if needed; another 100 mg. in the afternoon.  I don't take this any time after 2 pm as I'll be up all night.  I do need to take a prescribed sleeping pill in order to get to sleep since I've been on Provigil.,I initially started on 200 mg. daily and have cut back as I do have trouble getting to sleep and staying asleep.  I have been on this for 7 months and the effectiveness of Provigil is at the same level today as it was when I began.

I would get up in the am no brain fog; and could work the whole day not being tired. By night time though I was exhausted. After a month or so I still get up early but by afternoon I am so tired I usually try to take a nap or just keep going and eventually it will get better. I have not tried taking another in the afternoon. I have tried to up the dose in the am with no difference. ,I am not sure if this is from the provigil or not but I have started having major breathing issues. I have had this a long time ago but started taking celexa for it and it worked. Now I am taking klonopin for it sometimes it works sometimes not. I wonder if it is being caused from the provigil.,I just take one 200mg every morning when I get up. If I do not take it I thought is why I would be so sleepy during the day. But now I get sleepy anyway. But the waking up early is great were as I could not get up before.

I've been taking this drug for 6 years now and I have no problem staying awake; sharp and focused. I no longer even drink coffee at night when I'm at work. This drug has changed my life.,When I first started; I was taking 200mg before shift. It gave me the jitters and a headache. But when I went to 100mg that took care of that problem.,I get home in the morning and go to bed; my mind will not stop thinking and I could easliy lay there for hours. My doctor prescribed Ambien and if I take that 10 minutes before going to bed I will fall right to sleep.

Helped me maintain focus and motivation at work. I still drank coffee throughout the day but it was significantly less with Provigil. Prior to Provigil I was prescribed Adderall XR 20 mg. which really had a negative effect on my duty performance. I had TOO much energy and jitters and could not focus on anything for more than 5 minutes. The opposite of what it was prescribed for. ,I began having stomach troubles with this drug. I now take Prilosec and Pepcid to counter this. Worth it? Sometimes. Like other reviews here; I found that the positive effects did wear off by the end of the day and dosing again is not smart if you want to get any sleep at all. In addition; I notice increased heart rate at times and seems to exacerbate the frequency and strength of my PVCs.,I do like the increased alertness and cognitive enhancement but not sure how Provigil is effecting my heart in the long term.

Mild increase in energy and productiveness; easier time staying on task and focusing; directing energy and finishing tasks. More motivated,Hyper-focus or obsessive focus at times; sometimes would experience generalized anxiety or generally overstimulated and uncomfortable; which would last for hours,At low doses; I find providgil to be moderately useful; particularly on days when I know I will need to focus and be productive and have energy for long periods of time; but sometimes I find it steers me towards being overly focused or obsessive on unimportant things; or it can make me feel uncomfortable or anxious for hours at a time

I am able to focus on tasks and concentrate better.  My concentration is clearer.  It's not habit-forming because I could live without it.  It's just that I can not function without it.  I can't drive; or stay awake for any reasonable length of time during the day.  My narcolepsy and sleep apnea are so bad that I do not dream at night at all.  With the provigil; along with my other medications; I am able to balance day and night and not feel like I'm fighting to keep my eyelids open.  Also; I don't need any caffeine or other stay awake medications that are harmful and habit-forming. ,During the first week; my heart rate increased as I increased the dose; but now my heart rate is perfectly normal.  I believe it may have given me a little headache/stomach ache the first week as well; but those are gone now too.,I take my provigil every morning; 3 200mg tablets.  I am awake for about the first 4 hours; then I nap for a little while.  I am up for about 2 hours; and nap again.  Then; I'm up for the evening; go to bed at a decent time and wake up at a regular hour feeling rested now.

I spoke with my gp & it was determined; that since my fatigue is so severe; we would move up immediately. Take 2 100mg tablets at 9a.m. then 1 100mg tablet at noon; should I be slowing down; with the engraved fatigue; I will change and rather than take 1 100mg tab at noon; I will take 2 200mg tabs at 1pm. Then by 4pm if needed take 1 100mg tablet. Will monitor closely; and go in monthly for Blood work; as this medication; can cause problems with the Liver. ,N/A currently,Awaiting to see what is going to happen; I am VERY hopeful !!!!

I can work more efficiently now; can get through my day without feeling like I need to lie down on the floor and sleep!,I notice that if I drink caffeinated beverages I get way too jittery; whereas I used to use coffee and diet caffeinated drinks to keep my energy level up and they wouldn't bother me by making me too hyper.  So I have to stay away from those.  Also; if I take a dose too late in the day; I stay up too late!,I have fibromyalgia; and was having a hard time with the high fatigue levels and difficulty concentrating.  At first I just took Wellbutrin to help with these things; but a doctor suggested trying Ritalin for better results.  It does work much better than the Wellbutrin for these symptoms.

I also began seeing a therapist once a week.  I saw improvement; but it was slow and graduate at first; particularly with the regard to the Zoloft.  I saw immediate improvement with the ritalin.

Our house became a much more peaceful place once he was better able to control his temper; which largely came from his frustration in knowing he was not doing as well as he could.,Initially; he experienced some sleepiness; but he adjusted to the medication and no longer has this problem.,We were initially reluctant to treat an otherwise healthy boy for what some describe as "boy" behavior; but he was increasingly frustrated with his inability to get along with siblings and classmates.  However; seeing now how much it has helped him - without making him into a different person -- we're glad we did.

Cocaine got me through grad school & my thesis; but ritalin allows me to function with out illegal stimulants -- problem is finding a doctor who will write rx for the dosage that is most effective (i.e. 20 mg 5x / day).  I am interested in a study that monitors efficacy / tolerance in patients who need / take high dosage on a long term basis.

Able to answer questions and engage in coversation. Increased organizational ability. Increased ability to attend to particular tasks without constantly moving towards another task. Ability to prioritize and to remember what original intentions were after beginning a task. ,If next dose not taken in a timely manner; effects wear off very quickly and suddenly very tired. Small bubbling in head at times. If dosage even slightly too high; then noticable heart palpitations present along with increased heart rate. Active dreaming if taken late in the day. ,It took a very long time to find the best medication and the best dosage. Over a year of trials. Medication is taken along with proper diet and increased physical activity. Omega 3 supplementation also added to routine. Important to note that nicotene is also taken regularly in the form of nicorette gum. All information above is based on the two together as complete treatment. Either on it's own is not enough.

I felt wonderful!  I was energetic and positive and I felt that I could handle anything that came my way.  I don't want to sound as though I felt euphoric or manic - I just felt really GOOD about life.  However; after only a few days; that sense of confident well-being drained away.,Initially; the medication kept me awake all night but that only happened for a night or two.  I take them on an empty stomach in the morning and sometimes my hands shake very slightly for a while but it's not enough to cause any problems.,My psychiatrist put me on it to 'give a boost' to my other antidepressant.  He says I am taking a miniscule amount; and that I could increase the dosage if I wished but I have been reluctant to do so.  Perhaps I should - I may not be taking enough to be effective but I am on three different antidepressants and I feel uneasy about sharply increasing the Ritalin dose.  In short; initially; I felt GREAT but now I feel just the same as ever - struggling with the thoughts that cause lack of energy & enjoyment in many spheres of life.
patient,59,female,ADD,none,none,Ritalin (Methylphenidate) ,Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Dopamine-Uptake-Inhibitors Sympathomimetics,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,10mg x3  taken everyday for the period of still taking it,Ritalin has saved my life from lethargy and procastination.  I can now focus and be productive.  I am participating in life now ... I wish I would have discovered this sooner.  But later is better than never; I am very grateful this drug exists.  It is not an amphetamine (which is good because I could get addicted to speed too easily); this does not amp me up; it makes me calm and inspired and focused; a HUGE change in my life.  I am actually enjoying being alive (which is saying a lot compared to where I was at before taking Ritalin),absolutely none.,I started with 2.5 mg 3x a day and gradually increased the dosage; then to 5mg 3 x a day and now I am doing the best at 10 mg. 3 x a day.  I will stay here at 30mg. total for the day.  They say no more than 60mg. a day but I am happy with 30mg for now.  
patient,45,female,ADHD; inattentive type,depressive disorder,Celexa,Ritalin (Methylphenidate) ,Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Dopamine-Uptake-Inhibitors Sympathomimetics,6,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,5 - 20mg   taken up to 3x daily for the period of 10 yrs,improved concentration; increased productivity; decrease in impulsivity; decrease in distractibilty; increased libido ,significant increase in anxiety; esp during times of stress; increased libido; increased anger; increased sweating; visible nervousness; increased emotional reactivity; short temper.,my doctor retired; and I went to a psychiatrist who has ADHD himself; and he prescribes Adderall; 20mg early morning and noon; and 10 mg mid  afternoon.  The sustained release doesn't work well overall for me. My focus isn't as strong as it was on Ritalin; but there is no problem with anxiety; and I don't need the Xanax.  
patient,28,female,ADD,none,none,Ritalin (Methylphenidate) ,Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Dopamine-Uptake-Inhibitors Sympathomimetics,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,20mg  taken twice a day for the period of 2 months,While i take this drug; i feel very well; happy; I can concentrate in my activities. It helps me to make decisions; I can complete activities; i talk a lot; i stay in a good mood; but just while is during the effects. ,My heart beats faster and i feel its not in a constant rhythm. My mouth is dry and I feel extremely anxious; and because of this; very clumsy.   ,My diagnostic of ADD was not really accurate. A did just some practical test but no brain exam. The doctor prescribe ritalin as a test; but because of the side effects I had to stop. I did psychotherapy during the treatment. The ritalin helped me but;of course; didn't stop my problems. I feel really better now; but i didn't find yet a drug to help instead of ritalin.
patient,54,female,narcolepsy,depression; hypothyroid; fibromyalgia,paxil; synthroid; flexeril,Ritalin (Methylphenidate) ,Central-Nervous-System-Stimulants Dopamine-Uptake-Inhibitors Sympathomimetics,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,20 mg slow release  taken 2x daily for the period of 10 years,No longer fell asleep at inappropriate and dangerous times. For the first time in my adult life I was able to concentrate. I was able to effectively work and study. ,Extreme fatigue when not taking ritalin such as on the weekend. Sometimes I was so fatigued; taking ritalin was unable to keep me awake. When I used ritalin during the day at work; it reduced my inhibitions in social and business situations and I would blurt out things before I had the chance to internally filter them. Experienced periods of sleeplesness at night. ,I would set the alarm for 6am; take ritalin; go back to sleep until 7am. This gave the ritalin time to kick in so I could feel awake when I arose. Just after lunch I would take a 2nd dose of ritalin 20mg SR to keep me awake and able to concentrate through the afternoon.
patient,28,female,Birth Control,none,OTC pain relievers,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,150mg/ml   taken every 10-13 weeks for the period of for 9 years,I was taking this drug as birth control; and it has been extremely effective.  (No children; yet!) The fact that you only need to take it four times a year is great; so it is difficult to miss a dose. (Unlike the pill; which you take everyday; and missing it even once alters it's effectiveness.)  As an added bonus; I no longer have my period; which were extremely painful and disrupted my life for a whole week every month.  I no longer suffer from PMS symptoms; either.  I can not complain about this drug at all.  ,I have not experienced any side effects from this medication.  Losing my period was an anticipated side effect; and although many feel that this is too much for them and discontinue use of this drug; it is a good side effect for me.  Also there are studies that show bone mineral density is affected by this drug; but I have undergone a bone density scan; with normal results.  This is great; considering I have been on Depo for nine years now; since I turned nineteen and for most of my twenties.,This drug is administered into a muscle by injection four times a year; by a physician.  The shot is given every ten to thirteen weeks.  Besides being used as birth control; it is also used to treat other conditions.  
patient,29,female,Birth Control,none when first starting depo,none when first starting depo,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,150 mg  taken (1) injection every 90 days for the period of Over 12 years total/break after 1st five,The main benefits were absolutely no pregnancy and no menstrual cycles.,The main side effects; which I noticed more predominately in the later stage of treatment was the contast hunger and weight gain as the result; moderate acne; and depression (I am still being treated for depression so this may not be due to depo; but it is actually one of the side effects).,I started depo-provera when I was 15 years old and continued treatment for five years and then stopped treatment at the suggestion of my doctor to take a break from it.  During the first ive years on depo; I had no adverse effects I maintained a constant weight of 112-1/2 pounds throughout the entire five years.  I started depo again at the age of 23 and was fine and maintained a constant weight until they switched me to the generic version at the age of 27 from that point on I struggled with constant hunger rapid weight gain and struggling to keep it under control; acne is another of the side effects I experienced after the switch to generic and depression.  The depression could be the result of fluxuating weight and acne or heredity.  I stopped depo treatment and switched to the copper IUD in November of 2007 and since then the constant hunger has stopped; I have already lost 10 pounds without really trying and the acne is beginning to decrease.  I still am receiving treatment for depression at the moment.  Hopefully; this will help you in your birth control decision.
patient,42,female,contraception,none,none,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,4,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1 shot every three months  (dosage frequency: 8 times)  for the period of 2 years,It was 100% effectiv as contraception; the mayor benefit is not having to rememeber to take the pill every day and that it has only one form of hormon; which is important for woman over 35; especially smokers.,The side effects were like a prevision of menopause - huge weight gain (20 pounds); incredible mood swings and severe bloating. My overall feeling was quite depressed and it took me a while to figure out that it had to do with the drug; not with what was going on in my personal life. I also thought that the weight gain was partially retlated to quiting smking.,One shot in the upper arm every three months; that's it!
patient,20,female,Contraception,none,none,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,1,Highly Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,1 shot every 3 months  (dosage frequency: 1 shot every 3 months)  for the period of 3 months,I did not get pregnant while on the depo shot... but then again my sex life was shot due to the constant bleeding.,Side effects were horrific. I gained weight; developed horrible acne; and i was severely depressed the entire time. When choosing the depo shot i was excited to not have to worry about taking the pill; lightening or stopping my periods; and the guaruntee of contraception. Boy was i wrong. All of the previous side effects were bad enough; but after the first month on the shot; i continued to have my period for nearly 2 months straight. for some reason my period never stopped. The worst part about this contraceptive is that once you take the shot; there is no going back. I highly recommend a different birth control. I am now on the nuvaring and so far i am pleased with the results. Mild nausea at night the first week but that is my only complaint. Much better choice if you are looking to avoid pills. :),I recieved the shot at family planning about 3 years ago. Please do yourself a favor and look to other options before choosing this drug. My experience was the hardest 3 months of my life both emotionally and physically. 
patient,21,female,birth control,none,none,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,1,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,shot once every 3 months  (dosage frequency: 3 shots/ 9 months)  for the period of 3 shots/ 9 months,did not get pregnant,HUGE weight gain of 20 pounds; moody; loss of sexual desire; periods that lasted two weeks; tons of breakthrough bleeding. On top of all that I had tons of body issues due to the weight gain. 20 pounds is very noticeable on my 120 pound frame! I would not recommend this to anyone! ,get the shot every 3 months
patient,24,female,Birth Control,None,None,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,1,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,One injection  (dosage frequency: every 3 months)  for the period of 6 months,Birth Control,Massive weight gain; 22kgs (?48pounds) in the first 3months. Massive mood changes; bacame very depressed (weight gain didnt help that one) Was emotional about the smallest things. Anxiety attacks. Angry over small things. Nightmares and sleep walking and talking ? if these are side effect of that drug but there was a definate increase in both (esp sleep talking) when i was on the drug. Increased appitite (the weight didnt come from nowhere) was warned about pos weight gain but was told that if you controlled your eating youd be fine but my hunger was crazy i would eat a main meal and 1/2 hour later be starving like i hadnt eaten all day. I found it really hard to control my intake due to my excessive hunger. I also had heavy spotting the whole time i was on it and for about 5 months after i stopped the injections. I guess it was a very effective birth control as i had become depressed; overweight; had my period the whole time and was more interested in food than sex. Over all was not worth taking it; i actually regret taking it; was devestating for a 18year old at the time to go through.  I also found it very hard to loose the weight during or afterwards; continued to gain weight for 6months after the last injection before any changes occured despite exercise and diet changes.,Birth control; 2x doses over 6months before i decided to stop treatment.
patient,29,female,contraception pill,none,none,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,1,Considerably Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,1 injection every 3 months  (dosage frequency: as above)  for the period of 6 months,prevented pregnancy as it is a form of contraceptive but unfortunately it takes away your libido and sex drive,weight gain:25kg in 3 weeks;never recovered my original weight and it has been 9 years now.it blocks your sex drive not to say it cuts it off completely;depression,one injection and my life turned to hell as started to bloat like a milking cow;lost self esteem and fiance;lost friends;lost will to live;no sex drive;no self love
patient,49,female,pregnancy prevention,smoker,none,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,10,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,150 ml IM injecton  (dosage frequency: every 3 months)  for the period of 18 yeas,No pregnancy;no periods for 18 years; no menopause; estrogen production stopped; convenience,prolonged but very minimal menopausal symptoms....joint pain; headaches; vaginal dryness.  no significant weight gain; no significant rise in cholesterol levels or blood pressure,IM injection once every 3 months.  Prescribed at the age of 30 because of being a smoker and should not use the oral birth control.  Zinged through menopause and didn't even know it.  After 18 years; stopped injections and did not re-start menstrual flow at all.  It's been over 1.5 years since last injection and no side effects or withdrawal symptoms.
patient,20,female,preventing pregnancy,N/A,None,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,4,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,one shot   (dosage frequency: once every three months)  for the period of one year,In one year; I only had two periods. My periods before Depo were 2-3 days and very light; on Depo they were longer and heavier. It is so convenient not having to remember to take a pill everyday at the same day. It was also 100% effective with preventing pregnancy for me.,The first side effect I noticed was my complete lack of sex drive. After this came the ridiculous mood swings that caused fights with my boyfriend over nothing. I would just cry for no reason at all and I felt like I was going insane. Breast tenderness was also becoming an annoyance because it would last for months. While these side effects were severe to me; the worst is the huge concave I now have in my thigh. While I had a total of four injections; only one caused a huge dimple. It's really embarassing and extremely noticable and I'm not sure why it happened. The doctor said it has happened to a few other patients including discoloration of the injection site. This is when I got off Depo and switched to Seasonique... Hopefully; this will work out better. ,If you don't like receiving shots; this is definitely not the right method. It is a pretty large injection.  However; you only have to endure it four times a month and it's not painful.
patient,25,female,birth control,Depression; anxiety,celexa,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,5,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,1 shot per 3 months  (dosage frequency: every three months)  for the period of one year,It effectively prevented a pregnancy. And periods stopped immediately with rare and light spotting.,I had a few side effects. I got bad acne (which I haven't had since I was a teenager); and hair loss. I had lost 40 lbs before I began taking the shot. After my second shot I started gaining weight. I didn't change my eating habits in any negative way; and ended up gaining 20 lbs! ,I received the shot once every three months for a total of a year. The side effects outweigh the benefits in my opinion. I don't plan on taking this drug in the future; or recommending it to anybody else. I am definitely doing more research before I take another birth control again.
patient,18,female,birth control,N/a,n/a,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,5,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,1 shot   (dosage frequency: once every 4 mnths)  for the period of currently,well...it kinda stops the urge to have it.,constant back and stomach cramps;breakthrough bleeding(really often);it made my interest in sex really really low because I developed dyspareunia(painful intercourse) and it made me avoid sex which made me considerably depressed..and depression may or may not be a side effect..but it definitely was a thing.,it basically makes you abstinent..the side effects just aren't worth it.
patient,33,female,Severe PMS and Menstrual Pain,None,None,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,standard 3 mo. injection  (dosage frequency: every 3 months)  for the period of 8 years,No more painful debilitating monthly cycles; complete with life destroying rollercoaster like mood swings.  Seems to work great for people with these particular problems (my sister has amenorrhea and had a horrible reaction; the never ending monthly cycle).  For me it ,I do not experience any side effects while on the depot; but if I do not take it on time; I have some mild side effects untill I recieve my injection.  I took the generic form for 6 months but noticed some undesireable changes to my mood (more anxious and irritable).  Despite the more favorable price I will never take the generic again.,One injection every three month.  Yearly exam and occasional bone density test.  I eat or supplement approximately 1;800 I.U. vitamin D and 1;500 mg calcium. Weight training at least 3x a week.
patient,26,female,Hormonal imbalances and pregnancy prevention,None,None,Depo-Provera (Medroxyprogesterone) ,Contraceptives,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,1 shot every 3 months   (dosage frequency: every 3 months; administered by a nurse)  for the period of 3 years,After the first two shots I had no more periods until after being off Depo Provera for nearly 3 months. Also I didn't get pregnant; which was the goal. Before getting on birth control I had been a very moody person; fighting often with people who were important to me and whom I really didn't want to fight. On the shot I still had mood swings but they were not nearly as strong.,After getting off the shot it took nearly 2 years to get pregnant with our second child; however that was to be expected as it took over a year to get pregnant with my first (Depo was my first experience with birth control). There was mild weight gain; once I started dieting and exercising I was able to deal with it though. Some mild acne but nothing anyone besides me ever noticed.,I'd visit the doctor's office once a month. At my original clinic; I would simply walk in and a nurse would inject me; after we moved to another state I learned I would have to wait 1.5-2 hours for a doctor to see and inject me; even with an appointment it could take a while. Once I had received it though I was good to go for 3 more months.
patient,31,female,birth control,n/a,n/a,Mirena (Levonorgestrel) ,Contraceptives Hormones,3,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,standard  (dosage frequency: one time insertion good for five years)  for the period of 3 years,the treatment benefits were that i did not get pregnant nor did i get a period. occasional spotting but nothing a pantiliner couldn't handle.,the side effects are individual and unfortunately you don't know which ones will effect you the most. my personal side effects were horrible acne; weight gain; hair loss; extreme irritability.,just like with any iud you wait for your menstrual cycle to start and have the device inserted then. this was three months after my children were born. approximately one month later i started noticing that my skin was starting to break out really bad; especially on my mid face down; neck; chest and back. i was getting very large cysts which i never had even as a kid. normal zits every now and then but never ones that would leave a scar. when treatments and products wouldn't help i called my obgyn and they told me that was "a common side effect; sorry." well over the course of the next few months i stopped getting a period but would know when my period should've been here because my mood swings were out of control. i would get so angry over nothing. and the next day i would get some cramping. i started keeping track of this and realized that these episodes were happening about every four weeks or so. i also have never felt so bloated and swollen in my life. i sometimes wake up and my fingers don't have any lines on the knuckles. exercise helps this; but i still can't seem to lose those "last 10" pounds. i've spoken to other women who have similiar if not worse effects than me. but the consensus is always that something negative happened after they got it. 
patient,29,female,Contraception,None,None,Nuvaring ,Contraceptives Hormones,8,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,Single  (dosage frequency: once a month)  for the period of six months,Required only one application per month; rather than having to take a pill everyday. Was also a lower dosage than the pill; which seems better. Because it is not ingested there was no nausea.,Lower doses can lead to a slight increase in PMS symptoms such as cramping; but these can be combated with mild pain relievers. Sometimes can be felt during intercourse.,A plastic ring which releases hormones over a period of three weeks to provide contraceptive benefits. It is inserted into the vagina after your period; left for three weeks and then removed to allow for the next period.

I was very happy with the absence of side effects and the overall simplicity of the drug.,The NuvaRing was inserted once a month and kept in place for three weeks. After the third week; the ring was removed so that a menstrual cycle could ensue. After 7 day; a new ring was inserted. There was no pain associated with the insertion or removal of the ring; nor was there any discomfort during sexual intercourse. Overall I am very pleased with the NuvaRing and will continue to use it until I decide to become pregnant.

I HAVE HAD A LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH BIRTH CONTROL THROUGHOUT MY LIFE. HAVING TRIED MANY IF NOT ALL POSSIBLE  BIRTH CONTROL TREATMENTS; I BELIEVE THIS IS THE ONE THAT WORKS THE BEST FOR ME. IT IS PRACTICAL AND VERY FEW SIDE EFFECTS WHEN COMPARED TO THE ORAL CONTRACEPTIVES; IUDs OR  INJECTIONS. ,SO FAR; I HAVE ONLY EXPERIENCED HEADACHES AROUND THE TIME WHEN I TAKE OUT MY RING. ,IT IS VERY EASY TO USE; YOU INSERT IT IN THE VAGINA; IT STAYS IN FOR 3 WEEKS AND TAKE IT OUT FOR ONE TO HAVE YOUR PERIOD.

Fortunately my skin stayed just as clear and as a plus no more taking pills nightly,slight vaginal irritation at the end of a cycle; nothing even moderately serious though.,Nuva Ring is a brand name birth control method which releases hormones through the vaginal walls. You insert a flexible plastic ring once a month for three weeks and it acts as birth control.

With my first baby; I got pregnant immediately; within only a month of trying and now; I can't get pregnant.  My periods come along once every 3 to 6 months and are extremely severe; lasting for well over a week and are very heavy.

patient,25,female,Birth Control,None,None,Nuvaring ,Contraceptives Hormones,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,One Ring  (dosage frequency: once a month)  for the period of 2 Months and Still,Ability to have benefits of birth control in the convenience of a ring; that allows freedom from worrying about taking a pill and an unwanted pregnancy.,My first week with the ring I experienced extreme nausea; upset stomach and a tremendous decrease in appetite.  These symptoms slowly faded as the weeks passed.  Now the only side effects I notice are a less than normal appetite and occasional vaginal irritation; but nothing to painful or bothersome that I feel the need to seek medical treatment.,I'm married; I have both a full & part time job and I'm enrolled 15 hrs in school.  The ONE LESS STRESS of NOT having to worry about birth control let's me focus on what's important right now.  This is my method of choice and will be until I decide I'm ready for children.  Nuvaring is reliable... you can't really mess it up.  The fact that I don't have to worry about a little pill everyday makes my quality of life better.  I have the Nuvaring timer; which you can order from the website; that aids in reminding me that it's time; whether it be insertion or removal; and can be reset for whatever day you choose for insertion.  I can see how one might forget they even have it in them.  I do not feel it; my husband cannot feel it; and it has not fallen out; like several other women have claimed.  I'm very pleased with this and hope that it works as well for others as it has for me.

It gives me the reassurance that I'm not pregnant because usually my periods would be almost half a month to a month late. Also; I have yet to become pregnant; but I still use additional protection at all times.,None. I don't understand how it could bring about side effects really. It doesn't cause weight gain. If you gain weight on this; it's your own fault for eating too much! =] The only thing I can think of is when I go to the bathroom it comes out a bit; but nothing that can't be fixed immediately. Never come completely out yet without me physically removing it.,Simple. I would 100% recommend this.

Before I started Nuvaring I had never in my life had one.  While on it; I must have had at least six.  I have been off of the ring now for three months and have not had one.

I have had no vaginal dryness;my sex drive is still the same (high); no cramping; matter of fact; I was cramping very badly the day that I started the ring and within an hour of insertion; my cramps went away.  I actually had blood clots before I started the ring; and now my periods are so much more lighter so I am not clotting at all. :)  Also; my period duration has been cut in half from 5-7 days to 3 or 3.5 days.  I think it's AWESOME!!  My partner does not feel it at all and we have it enthusiastically (vigorously)!  ,I had a very bad headache for about a week; but it's ok now.  I had a sinus infection last week; and I thought it was from it being springtime; but then I read that sinus infections could be a side effect.  I felt pretty awful last week and wanted to sleep a lot.  I am still not sure if it was just allergies or not.,I feel sorry for the women who have had negative side effects with the Nuvaring.  So far so good; so I am sticking to it!!

Multiple blood clots in my lungs almost killed me. I was lucky to live because the clot lodged in parts of my lungs that were not fatal.,Doctor inserted the NuvaRing during the office visit. No literature was provided so was not given the easy opportunity to read about side effects. There was no discussion with the doctor about side effects.
patient,23,female,Birth Control,none,none,Nuvaring ,Contraceptives Hormones,3,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1 ring per month  (dosage frequency: every month)  for the period of 4 months,It was nice to not have to worry about a pill every day; you can put one ring in and then don't have to worry about it for 3 weeks.,I noticed that I felt really down around month two of taking in; my mood swings were severe; I felt tired ALL THE TIME. I could also feel the ring during sex and it frequently came out during sex. ,ALthough it is convenient; it almost defeats the purpose of birth control if you have to worry all the time that the ring is going to come out. also; mood swings and feelings of tiredness were almost unbearable. would not recommend it.

So it's effective. It also slowed my periods a lot; i had heavy bleeding and severe cramping before; and now I have a 4 day period with cramping usually only on the first day. It has kept my skin SO clear; and it's almost too easy. Just mark your calendar for the third sunday after insertion; and that's when it comes out!,I don't know if many people have had this; or maybe it's just a coincidence that it started at the same time; but i have developed irritable bowel syndrome since using it. Also; I can't ever seem to get it in far enough; it's always slipping down. It is felt TOO much during sex; so i have to remove it everytime. It's painful for us both if left in. I sometimes feel mentally unstable and can't remember if I felt this before.,Put it in on sunday; three sundays from then you take it out. You'll start your period on wednesday; then put a new one in that following sunday. TOO EASY!

PLEASE,NONE,NONE,Nuvaring ,Contraceptives Hormones,3,Highly Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,5  (dosage frequency: daily)  for the period of one week,Never got pregnant,My dosage was so high that at the end of a week I couldn't fit any more up there.  My boyfriend couldn't get his member inside of me; and when he finally did it gave him severe gouges on his shaft.  It caused me to stop eating; and when I did I just threw it up... It caused me to become violent; I even struck my boyfriend a few times during an argument.  I was on my period the entire week; the bleeding just wouldn't stop.  It was horrible.  Not to mention; the pain I felt inside of my vagina was tremendous.  I could hardly sit down by the end of the week.  I do not recommend that anyone believes this.,I used five rings daily; before every intimate encounter.  Ouch!

I had never had a yeast infection before; nor have I ever had problems getting rid of a yeast infection.   I believe the ring was the culprit.,I went to my doctor to complain about the yeast infections.  It seemed like every time I inserted a new NuvaRing; I got a yeast infection.  She told me to use Monistat; and see if that works.  It worked for a week; but then I developed another yeast infection.   I went back to my doctor/gyno.  She prescribed me Diflucan; an antifungal pill taken by mouth.  I was to take 1 pill every time I started a new ring.  I still had yeast infections.  My doctor then advised me to take the Diflucan every other day for 3 days after starting a new ring.  No improvement.   She then prescribed me a vaginal cream containing steroids and an  anti-inflammatory.   I gave up -  the next time I went to the doctor; I had her prescribe me a new birth control.  I'm back on the pill; Loeastrin24FE.  Haven't had a yeast infection since the switch off the nuvaring.

It helped control my acne and kept me thin.  After several years I did notice a decrease in my libido which came back after I stopped taking birthcontrol pills altogether.  I was put on the generic version of this pill at somepoint and I had a completely different reaction.  I instantly gained about 15 pounds (mostly water weight I think because I looked puffy).  I found out after this reaction that generic pills don't have to be identical to the brand name drugs.  I learned the hard way.,I never got pregnant.,I took the same little pill for 21 days and then the placebo pills for another 7 days of the month.

This pill is also touted as being one that helps in the treatment of acne; although I honestly can't say that it changed my acne pattern whatsoever. I tend to break out around the time of my monthly cycle; and I continued to break out even during the time I was on this pill. I didn't notice any decrease in my break-outs.,The only side effect I noticed was a diminished sex drive. ,I was told to start the monthly dosage on the first Sunday following the cessation of my period. I then continued taking one pill a day to prevent pregnancy.
patient,28,female,acne,none,none,Ortho TRI-Cyclen (Norgestimate / Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,3,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,regualr dose for birth control  (dosage frequency: daily)  for the period of 3 years,I was given this birth control to help stabilize my hormones to aid in clearing up my acne.  I never saw a significant improvement in my acne.  ,I suffered some very negative side effects.  First; this medication made me nauseated.  Secondly; and the effect that I am still trying to recover from; this medication gave me the "pregnancy mask" which is a darkening above the lip area.,I was to take this birthcontrol pill daily to aid in the hormonal fluctuations that possibly were contributing to my acne.

patient,25,female,birth control,none,none,Ortho TRI-Cyclen (Norgestimate / Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,standard hormone dose  (dosage frequency: daily)  for the period of 4 years,With proper administration I never feel too many side effects associated with hormonal imbalances.  I also use it as my primary source of birth control have never become pregnant.  Even during months that I failed to take it at the same time every day; I did not become pregnant.  The pill is super tiny and easy to swallow.,You have to be careful to take the appropriate dose (one pill per day at the same time). You MUST keep it on you at all times so that you are able to do so.  Missing a dose would often induce my period which would linger for weeks.  I also noticed a dramatic difference in the quality of my hair.  Over the last few years of taking the medication I have lost over 75 percent of the super thick head of hair I once had.  ,The treatment is relatively simple and safe.  It is also supposed to decrease your chance of cervical cancer.  Take one pill each day and there is a 99 percent chance of not getting pregnant.  However; you can increase your risk of blood clotting if you are a smoker.  You highly advised to be smoke free throughout treatment.  Once treatment stops you must seek another form of birth control.
patient,30,female,Birth Control/Control of Menstrual Cycle,None,None,Ortho TRI-Cyclen (Norgestimate / Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,4,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,Not sure  (dosage frequency: daily)  for the period of 3 months,The Ortho Tri-Cyclen provided effective birth control; and it also did cause my mentstrual cylcle to be more regular. My periods were less heavy; and I did not have such severe menstrual cramping each month while I was taking the pills. There are no other benefits to taking the pill that I am aware of. ,I experienced migraine headaches several times per week where I could not do anything other than lay down with the lights off while on this medication. At first; I had no idea what was causing them; but my doctor informed me that my symptoms could be indicative of a more severe side effect; and she therefore advised me to stop taking them. They also caused some bloating and moodiness. ,The Ortho Tri-Cyclen birth control pills are a low dosage progesterone treatment that is intended to prevent pregnancy. I was required to take one pill every day. My understanding is that I experienced a relatively rare side effect with the migraines. I have not heard any similar complaints from friends who were taking the same pill; other than complaints about weight gain; bloating and mild acne. 
patient,27,female,prevent pregnancy,iron deficiency,N/A,Ortho TRI-Cyclen (Norgestimate / Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,7,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,one pill daily  taken once a day for the period of 7.5 years,Ortho Tri Cyclen effectively prevented pregnancy; cleared up acne; gave me regular periods; helped with iron deficiency due to blood loss,Thinning hair; bleeding gums; eventually the iron deficiency came back,I began taking Ortho Tri Cyclen at age 20.  It gave me regular periods (they aren't really 'periods;' they are just a withdrawl from the hormones) and less cramping; lighter flow.  It got rid of my acne. I did not get pregnant in my 7.5 years of taking the drug.  I think that eventually the pill prevents you from absorbing nutrients because my iron deficiency came back. I am not sure if the nutrient absorption has anything to do with having bleeding gums more often; but I did have a lot of pain because of a dislodged clot when I got my wisdom teeth removed and the oral surgeon said that this happens more often to women who take birth control. I stopped taking the pill to find more natural ways of birth control; and because my hair was becoming thin and brittle. I also don't like the stories of the effect hormones are having on our environment (going into groundwater).

Depo Provera was horrible; and I wasn't to crazy about Yazmin but that's good too. I didn't like the patch either. Mabey my breast have gotten a little meatier but they don't hurt at all.

I felt slow; distant; and complacent.  I felt like a dumbed-down; watered-down version of myself.  The physical effects were also disturbing: I developed a dark brown discharge and grew black hairs around my nipples.  But the most extreme side effects actually occurred when I went OFF the pill; which I had to attempt twice before I could get through it: I experienced the most severe depression of my life; several week-long; heavy periods; hair loss; and very bad acne.,Typical: 1 pill per day.

My breasts went from a full C cup to a full D cup!  I'm on lexapro so that might be the reason i didn't experience really bad mood swings or any depression like some people said they have.  Nothing really changed other than that and it's great to know when i will get my period.,For the first month of taking ortho tri cyclen i was a little moody.  When my period started the first month i was very moody but that only lasted about 3 days.  The second month of my period my pms calmed down and now i have no mood swings and only one day of cramps.,I take the sunday start pills everyday in the afternoon.

When I wasn't on the pill I was irregular and spotted often.,Severe headaches; nausea; increase in appetite; heavy weight gain.  My head hurt a lot.  I would have to take pain killers just to get through my work day.  Sometime when I come home I'd have to lay down.

I went to this dermatologist and he said that what could be causing my acne is the hormones balance; (if you have too much feminine or masculine hormones it can cause acne)so he said i could try to take birth control pill to balance my hormones. and so i started. In the first month my acne got worse;but i still kept taking Yasmin(birth control pill); on the third month i started noticing that my skin was clearing from all those pimples.I have been taking it for more than 6 months now and i have no acne! sometimes one or two comes out but it goes away in 2 days.So Yasmin worked for me and could work for you too!,I always had bad blood circulation so i would feel my legs a little bit swallow!,if in the first months you see that your acne is getting worse; dont stop taking it till the forth month.you will se the difference.
patient,28,female,Birth Control,None,None,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,7,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,28 days  (dosage frequency: every day)  for the period of Two years,Effective birth control,Moodiness and weight loss,Hi - I switched from Ortho Tri Cyclen to Yasim because the country I moved to did not have Ortho Tri Cyclen.  It was fine but I feel like it made me moody.  Although the pluses were slight weight loss.  When I moved back to the US I went back to Ortho Tri Cyclen because I did not like the moodiness.  Both drugs have done wonders for my skin.  
patient,29,female,Controceptive; help with pmsd,PMSD,None,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,1,Highly Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,1 pill per day  taken once per day for the period of 2 months,Prevented pregnancy; i did not experience any benifits whatsoever,Consistent regular flow menses for the entire 2 months; hormonal inconsistency- felt sad; mood swings. The side effects were so extrme; it frightened me and prevented me from ever taking another oral controceptive.,Was put on low doasage; doctor advised to prescribe additional hormones to balance out levels. I opted out of taking it anymore.
patient,22,female,birth control,no negative medical conditions,none,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,1,Considerably Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,pills monthly  taken once daily for the period of about 6/7 months,i had clear clear skin. my skin was so acne free it looked like a photo shop picture. but that is the only positive to this birth control,extreme hunger. weight gain. severe emotional side effects that not only affected my life negatively but made me want to end it. i experienced severe depression; anxiety; anger  and rage. i lacked any sex drive whatsoever. constant fighting and feelings of guilt; remorse and worthlessness. ruined relationships tremendously and i couldnt do anything to stop my behavoir except stop taking the birth control. it was the worst thing i have ever experienced in my entire life. my life is not that bad-i had no reason to feel the ways i did during use of this birth control. i literally thought i was going crazy..and i still feel terrible til this day about the ruined relationships.,i recommend using this birth control with caution although everyones body responds differently to all medications. if you begin to notice negative emotions (even slightly) i recommend you stop using it IMMEDIATELY--because it only gets worse. since i have stopped taking it (4-5 months ago) i have slowly regained the things i had lost..including my boyfriend. just be careful
patient,36,female,Birth control,None,None,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,0.3 mg  taken daily for the period of 3 years,Yasmin is an excellent birth control pill.  Not only does it prevent pregnancy; but it decreases bloating; irritability; and monthly blood lost.  There is decreased break through bleeding and cramps as well.  It just became available in a generic; so bringing the cost much lower.,The "side effects" were shorter and lighter periods.,Birth control; decreased monthly bleeding.
patient,18,female,birth control,none,celexa,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,3,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,.3  (dosage frequency: 1 a day)  for the period of 2 months,There was no chance of pregancy because i lost 100 percent of my libido. My skin cleared up for the most part.,no libido what so ever. My breasts hurt like no other... they got bigger and itched because they were so swollen. I couldn't have an orgasm except for durring the 7 day placebo period. I got my period while on the pill and didn't have one durring the off days.,I was given this to prevent pregnancy and i am going off because i'd rather have a child and an orgasm than no child and no orgasm
patient,22,female,Contraception,None,None,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,1,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,1 pill a day; 21 days a month  taken once a day; 21 days a month for the period of About a year,periods,in skin lustre and elasticity,Lost interest in sex rapidly; if I was ever aroused (very rare) I couldn't achieve an orgasm; every part of my body seemed to dry out and subsequently age a bit and in the case of my eyes this drying and ageing process was pretty severe. Doctors were baffled as to why I'd ended up with such dry eyes at such a young age; said they weren't sure what caused it but said it normally happens to menopausal or elderly women (I was 20-21 at the time). Now looking back I realise that the dry eyes match with a lot of the other symptoms I was experiencing at the time; many of which are normally symptoms of the menopause/ageing. Considering these symptoms have now either completely disappeared or improved since stopping the use of hormonal birth control methods (I now use the copper IUD); I believe they may well have been linked Yasmin. Yasmin is one scary pill- I came off it worried that I was prematurely going through the menopause and that I would never be able to enjoy painless; bloodless; pleasurable sex again.      
patient,22,female,Birth Control,N/A ,NONE,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,3,Marginally Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,One pill a day  taken every day for the period of 2 years,Less acne; more controlled cycle,headaches; dizzy spells; extreme breast tenderness (like someone is crushing them); anxiety; slight depression; very bad cramps; very large clots; mood swings; heart palpitations,Got on Yasmin to weaken my flow; my acne from the previous pill went away (ortho tri clyclen-lo); everything seemed great. I was slightly discouraged about my weight gain; a few pounds here and there; but 2 years later I am 40lbs heavier than I was when I started this pill. I do not solely blame the pill for this but I can imagine it has aided me in packing on the pounds. I exercise regularly and try to watch what I put in my mouth. I have random weird mood-swings that only seem to be getting worse. I stopped taking this pill the other day because I couldnt stand always being tired; fatigued; moody; and the headaches were unbearable. I have had a few since that day but hopefully everything will start to get better. I am looking for alternative pills because most of them make my acne really bad; and I have never had acne as a teenager. My mothers friends daughter was only on this pill 3 months and had liver problems. My health isnt worth it. I would rather bleed for 8-9 days than possibly die. Be careful ladies.
patient,26,female,Birth Control,Lazy thyroid,none,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,5,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,i don't remember  (dosage frequency: once a day)  for the period of 2.5 months,skin was a bit clearer and breasts got about half a cup bigger (but that came with the rest of my body getting bigger; too).,suspect; but am not sure; that Yasmin also gave me some vaginal dryness. I had frequent painful sex; would get raw very easily; and actually got a tear inside my vagina from sex. If we went at it twice a day it seemed I would need a day or two break just to recover. (None of this has happened before; so the doctor suggested I move to a lower dose pill.) ,Take once a day at the same time everyday. 
patient,27,female,birth control,mild anxiety,none,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,3mg/.03mg  taken once a day for the period of 3 years,Yasmin is the fourth birth control pill i've tried and the only one i haven't had to discontinue due to adverse physical and emotional side effects. While on Yasmin I experienced no weight gain or moodiness whatsoever. In addition to preventing pregnancy Yasmin helped to slightly decrease my anxiety levels without a feeling of mania or malaise as is often accompanied by the use of anti-depressants. The pill also seemed to help with breakouts associated with my monthly cycle.  ,I had to stop purchasing the drug because the cost was $60; even with a PPO insurance plan. It took six months for my cycle to re-acclimate after beginning the hormones.  ,Yasmin is a birth control pill I took once a day. I personally sought out a method of birth control that I could take with minimal side effects. I was prescribed the pill after I went to my doctor and asked her to prescribe it. 
patient,32,female,Birth Control,Asthma,Albuterol and Zyrtec,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,3,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,1/day  (dosage frequency: 1/day)  for the period of 3 months,None,Sore breasts; moodiness,I took this pill for 3 months at the exact same time each day and ending up getting pregnant. Looking back I am glad I did; because I can't imagine life without my Yasmin baby as we call him; but an unplanned prepnancy with a small child already was not fun.  I do not recommend.
patient,26,female,Birth control,none,none,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,3,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,low dose estrogin and progestin (equal)  (dosage frequency: 1 per day; 21 day cycle.)  for the period of 6 months,My skin was flawless and I had a very youthful glow. My acne went away completely. My breasts were much fuller and my body looked more curvy and feminine; even though I worked out daily and didn't change my eating habits.,The most negative side effect was the mood alteration. I became a completely different person. Very depressed and crying all the time for no reason. It was very very strange. Not like me at all. My mood would change constantly like a yo-yo. Also; I gained weight and felt like I was retaining water. A week before my period I would feel weak and feverish. ,My OBGYN explained that this oral contraceptive uses a synthetic progestin known as drospirenone. He suggested that it might be the cause of my negative side effects. He also said that it was more appropriate for women in their mid-30's or those who have experienced adverse effects from other oral contraceptives. He switched me to ortho tri cyclen-lo and I haven't had any problems whatsoever. I also don't have the benefits either.
patient,22,female,Cramps; birth control,None,None,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,3.0 mg for 24 days; 0.02 for 4 days  taken daily for the period of 2 years,Treatment benefits included prevention of pregnancy; clearer; more manageable skin; reduced menses and significantly reduced cramps. I never had another huge cystic acne after taking this medication. I had very VERY tiny acne occasionally. I mainly went to the doctor for heavy cramps. Now each month I do not suffer from cramps and am very happy. ,I was warned birth control can cause mood swings; I did not have any significant ones. Maybe around the time of my period. Also; I gained about 5 pounds after going on the pill; but lost it eventually by upping my exercise and watching closer what I ate. For some reason; I think it's easier to gain weight on this pill; but I don't know if it's just in my head. When I first got on this birth control; I had an intense craving for eggs and ate eggs 3 weeks straight. Again; I don't know if I'm imagining things but I would lose 5 pounds during the sugar pill? Maybe it's because I'm tired all of the time.,I always take the pill at night with lots of water. I am told Yasmin increases the amount of potassium and extra water will flush out the excess. This could be a problem because there's been rumors (not confirmed; but rumors) Yaz might have to be either modified or off the market because of this; according to my doctor. It's expensive; I'm not going to lie. I pay almost 70 bucks per month because I have no insurance.  Make sure you exercise on this pill; because I really think it makes you sluggish easily so you could gain more weight. I've never tried generic.
patient,37,female,contraception,ovarian cyst,none,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,daily dose   (dosage frequency: daily)  for the period of 5 years,pregnancy prevention,dry eyes; anal fissure - both were diagnozed by my phisicians. Initially I didn't attribute these side effects to Yasmin; but both improved dramatically once I stopped taking the medication. The fissure would heal for 3 year and I considered this condition cronic - but it healed within a months of me stopping Yasmin. ,standard; daily contraception routine - one pill taken every night for 21 days followed by 7 placebo pills
patient,21,female,prevent pregnancy,none,none,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,1,Moderately Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,one a day  (dosage frequency: everyday)  for the period of end of 3rd week,prevented getting pregnant,severe stomach pain at night;extreme appetite during the day; and always tired,I am only at the end of my 3d week but i feel like i have no control over my appetite. I feel so hungry all the time and no matter how much I eat I cant get full. Be aware. Also always being tired doesnt help. 
patient,18,female,Birth Control,Acne,none,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,Daily  (dosage frequency: daily)  for the period of 4 years,I've been on yasmin four years now; it works so great! I have no side effects; just nausea if I take two at a time and that is hardly ever.  But my acne completely went away and no pregnancy the whole time I've been on it! Would definently recommend to anybody.,None,.
patient,20,female,Contraception,N/A,N/A,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,5,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,1 a day  (dosage frequency: 1 a day)  for the period of 3 month,Protection aganst pregnancy. Some weight loss; less hungry. Less acne. No effect on sex drive. ,So tearful that had to stop taking it. Could cry an cry for 2-3 hours which never happened otherwise. Depressed. ,Took for 3 months. First month was OK but by the end of the 3rd month it was hellish
patient,19,female,Birth Control,none,n/a,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,1,Highly Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,1 pill/day for 21 days  taken once a day for the period of a year and a half,By taking Yasmin I did not get pregnant; as it did act as a proper birth control method.  However the side effects outweighed the benefits and I was forced to switch to a new form of birth control. I would NEVER recommend this type of birth control.,Severe depression; mood swings; weight gain; longer period; yeast infections; and numerous other effects.,1 pill daily for 21 days and then a week break.
patient,26,female,birth control; menstrual cramps,cramps and face breakouts,none,Yasmin (Ethinyl Estradiol) ,Contraceptives Estrogens Hormones,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,one pill a day   taken one pill a day for the period of 3 months,the treatment benefits were reducing acne; helping me to have a more clear complexion.  Also it GREATLY reduced my cramps.  And; to this day; I am not pregnant :)  The benefits of this "pill" were far greater than any others I have tried; and I have tried several different brands.,The treatment side effects were minimal.  In fact I can't think of any.  I have tried many different types of the pill where it had side effects on my face; barely reduced cramps; however this one didn't have any of those side effects and I continue to use it.,it was one pill a day; as any birth control pill is usually taken.  I took them properly and that is probably one reason why the benefits were great.  However I took the other brands at the right time to and they didn't work as well.
patient,65,female,diabetes,NONE,NONE,Actos (Pioglitazone) ,Diabetes-Management Diabetes-Management,7,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,15 mg.  taken one a day for the period of I have been taking it for 5 years,THE TREATMENT BENEFIT IS TO CONTROL THE GLUCOSE IN MY BLOOD; ALONG WITH A HEALTHY DIET AND AVOID SWEETS AND STARCHES.,NO SIDE EFFECTS SO FAR; BUT ALL PRESCRIPTION DRUGS HAVE SOME EFFECTS WITH THE YEARS. THAT'S WHY I TRY TO STAY AWAY FROM DRUGS.,I TAKE ONE ACTOS 15 MG IN THE MORNING. HAVE BLOOD TESTS DONE EVERY 3 MONTHS TO CHECK MY KIDNEYS; GLUCOSE LEVEL; CHILESTEROL; ETC. ALSO HAVE MY EYES CHECK EVERY 12 MONTHS; AND MY FEET AS WELL.
patient,42,female,diabetes,narcolepsy,provigil,Byetta (Exenatide Injection) ,Diabetes-Management Diabetes-Management,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,10mcg  (dosage frequency: 2x daily)  for the period of 2 years,helped to stay awake; without the side effects that I had when I used to take dexedrine; like jittery; agitation; dry mouth,There really weren't any side effects like those described above from dexedrine.,100-150 mg a day; 100mg taken in the am; 50mg in pm (if needed) to help with daytime sleepiness; caused by narcolepsy.  I usually do not take the afternoon dose unless I feel really tired and nervous about driving.
patient,45,male,Diabetes Type II,Obstructive Sleep Apnea,Metformin,Byetta (Exenatide Injection) ,Diabetes-Management Diabetes-Management,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,10 mcg  (dosage frequency: 2 x day)  for the period of 3 years,Byetta will raise insulin production in the presence of increased blood glucose only; and do so gradually. It reduced my post prandial readings substantially; and also (when taken at least 30-60 minutes before meals) slowed gastric emptying; allowing me to feel full quicker and eat less. ,Mild nausea for the first couple of weeks within 20 minutes of injection. Faintness and cramps if food is not consumed within 60 minutes of injection. Overeating will tend to produce sluggishness due to the corresponding large insulin release.,Byetta is a subcutaneous injectable of 5 or 10 mcg exenatide; and artificial hormone derived from Gila monster saliva (!) It allows one to mimic some of the advantages of Gila monster digestion; like a steady rise in insulin production that matches increases in blood glucose; and delayed gastric emptying. One takes the drug 15-60 minutes before breakfast and again before dinner. Injectable is in the form of a pen with disposable screw on needles that lasts for four weeks.
patient,51,female,Diabetic,blockage & allergies,metformin; allegra; lipator; tricor,Byetta (Exenatide Injection) ,Diabetes-Management Diabetes-Management,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,10 mcg  (dosage frequency: twice daily)  for the period of 4 years,This  slows the sugar going into my system so that my body can use most of my own insulin to process the sugar.  It is to be taken along with the metformin. It has helped control my blood sugar very well.,It can sometimes cause nausea. At the start of treatment it was bad but now it only happens if I miss a dose then the next one will cause nausea.  The first couple of months I saw a very slight drop in weight but I am not sure if the Byetta caused this.,I take a shot before my first meal and last meal each day.  It is a very easy shot to give to myself but it is easy to forget if I eat out or if I am traveling.  
patient,56,female,obesity and diabetes,none,luvox; norvasc; metformin,Byetta (Exenatide Injection) ,Diabetes-Management Diabetes-Management,1,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,5mcg and 10mcg  (dosage frequency: 2 times per day)  for the period of 2 years,I initially had severe cramping and nausea; but I continued under doctor's orders; I only lost about 20 pounds; tops.  I now have a larger host of problems I believe were started with this medication.  I have not used in 3 years.,Severe cramping; headaches; incredible nausea; muscle cramps; vomiting blood (not once but on 2 occasions due to doctor's orders).  I now am facing something wrong with my digestive tract and no doctor has been able to figure out what is wrong.  Since this is the area where the medication was injected; and only there; I believe that the byetta is the perfect suspect.  Now; if I could only find a doctor that will listen to me.  The count is 5 and still increasing.  Recently; I lost 4 pounds in 3 days!!!!  This is not normal!,I was to inject the said amount into the abdominal (below the waist; above the pelvic bone) before breakfast and lunch.  The amount was changed when the medical professional I was having treat me decided to increase the dosage; and with terrible results (I was vomiting blood and could not eat or even drink water - I couldn't even stand the smell of food).  I wish I had never heard of Byetta!!!!!!
patient,66,male,type II diabetes mellitus,none,Prandin,Byetta (Exenatide Injection) ,Diabetes-Management Diabetes-Management,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,10 mcg twice daily  (dosage frequency: twice daily)  for the period of 3 years,Lowered HbA1C from 6.0 to 5.2 which has enabled me to go off numerous other anti diabetic medications which all had side effects.  The overall effect has been most agreeable including a loss of over 100 pounds of body fat.,Mild nausea if you didn't eat within one hour of use; otherwise there were no side effects noted.,Before breakfast and dinner inject 10 mcg subcutaneous.  I incidently also follow a strict low carbohydrate diet to achieve those HbA1C numbers and the weight loss.  It is difficult to exactly know which of these gave the greatest effect; but I believe they were synergistic.
patient,43,female,type 2 diabetes,none,metformin;amaryl,Byetta (Exenatide Injection) ,Diabetes-Management Diabetes-Management,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,5 mcg  (dosage frequency: twice a day)  for the period of just started two weeks ago,this drug kept my sugar down constantly to where it should be finally.i am very satisfied with it so far.,mild nausea and occasional diarrhea but it should stop within the next week or two.,i take byetta 2 x daily before lunch and dinner.after i eat i take my metformin and my amaryl.this works great for me.the doctor is trying to help me loose weight and get off the amaryl.
patient,64,female,diabetes,High blood prssure,Blood pressure meds,Byetta (Exenatide Injection) ,Diabetes-Management Diabetes-Management,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,10 mg  taken twice a day for the period of 1 1/2 years to date,Lowered blood sugar on a daily basis; lowered A1C ratings and led to a much better overall feeling of control for the diabetes.  Allowed for a more varied diet while keeping blood sugar controlled.  Insulin resistance seems to be in better control.  Lowered appetite which led to weight loss.  ,A little nausea when I first started taking the drub.,A patient is instructed to start out using the 5 mg pen for one month; then if doing well; progressing to the 10 mg pen.  Then the patient is monitored every 3-6 months to determine how well drug is controlling blood glucose which is done by taking the A1C test.
patient,34,female,PCOS/insulin resistance,hypothyroid,levothroxin,Glucophage (Metformin) ,Diabetes-Management,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,850 x 3  (dosage frequency: 3 times a  day)  for the period of indefinite,I went to the doctor complain of never losing weight despite dieting and exercises; and after some medical evaluation ; I was diagnosed with severe insulin resistance; polycysitc ovary syndrome ; and hypothyroid ;all which contributed to weight problem  ; my doctors plan was to take metformin at the maximum dose ; 850 mg ; 3 times and and to start a medication for my throid ; within 3 months I had lost 20 pounds ; normalized my periods and reversed my insulin resistance I was instructed to keep taking metformin  for the rest of my life,gastric side effects,I was instructed to tae the drug 3 times a day infintely
patient,39,male,Elevated Glucose,Hypertension,SSRI; ACE Inhibiter,Glucophage (Metformin) ,Diabetes-Management,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,500MG  taken once a day for the period of 1 year,Decreased Blood Glocose Levels. Decreased appitite. Less cravings for carbohydrates. ,Loose stools in first week of treatment. Minor stomach upset for first day or two of treatment. All side effects mild and transient.,Treatment once a day at night. Evidence suggests that glucophage/metformin mimics the biological effect of calorie restriction for life extension. 
patient,57,female,diabetes type 2,osteopinia; menopause symptons,Fosomax; HRT; Zoloft,Glucophage (Metformin) ,Diabetes-Management,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,250 ml  (dosage frequency: once per day)  for the period of about a year now,Lowering of blood sugar without risk of hypoglycemia,None,For years I took 4 ml glimepiride daily for type 2 diabetes; but often awoke in the middle of the night due to hypoglycemia.  Finally my doctor reduced my glimepiride to 2 ml daily and added 250 ml metformin daily.  For me; this combination is very effective.  It controls my blood sugar as well as the glimepiride alone without the concomitant hypoglycemia.  I understand that some people with borderline type 2 diabetes control their sugar levels with metformin alone; and my doctor may try this if my glycohemoglobin blood tests (HbA1C) stay in the low 6s.
patient,34,female,PCOS,hypothyroid,euythyrox,Glucophage (Metformin) ,Diabetes-Management,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,850   (dosage frequency: 3 time sday)  for the period of a year,Metformin restored my periods ; got rid of the cysts on my ovaries and help me lose weight ; restored insulin levels ,nausea and diarrea ; b12 defeciecy,I was told to strat taking 850 metformin once a day for 2 weeks and then increase the dossage to 850 2 times a day thne 3 times a day to correct insulin ressestance ; takinng it for 1 year helped with every thing ; I got my periods ; stoped craving sugar and lost weight ; so far this has been my miracle drug
patient,55,female,insulin resistance,none,none,Glucophage (Metformin) ,Diabetes-Management,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,750mg  taken once a day for the period of 1 year,I experienced weight loss; improved insulin sensitivity; increased energy and decreased carbohydrate cravings during the course of the day.,I did not experience any side effects from taking this medication.  I did have an occasional problem with some abdominal pain but it was not significant and went away on its own.,I took 1 (one) 750 mg pill once a day taken in the morning.  
patient,62,female,Diabetes,asthma,fenofibrate,Glucophage (Metformin) ,Diabetes-Management,7,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,4 x 500mg  taken once daily as time released for the period of 2 years,Once daily dose was more convenient than split doses of previous medication. The gradual release of the medication certainly reduced stomach and bowel problems (frequency and urgency of bowel movements) that had hampered activities beneficial to health such as hiking. The medication produced moderate control of my diabetes; though it is hard to judge what my blood sugar would have been without it,There is still some degree of bowel disturbance. however; the most concerning side effect (which is common to other (non time release) forms of metformin is impaired B12 and iron absorption. It took some time to identify this problem and I discovered it myself rather than being tested for it.,disconcerting feature is that the empty tablet cases pass through the body adn appear in the stools
patient,45,male,Diabetes Type 2,Asthma,Nexium; Albuterol,Glucophage (Metformin) ,Diabetes-Management,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,500mg daily  taken 1 time a day for the period of 3 weeks,None that I could see. Made me very sick and weak.,Nausea;chills;difficulty breathing;indigestion;dizziness;lightheaded;tired;anxiety,Prescribed about a month ago Recently diagnosed with Type 2 diabetes. Tried for the better part of three weeks. The side effects were mild at first; but intensified so much; I ended up in the ER. Stopped taking it two days ago and slowly regaining my strength.
patient,46,male,Diabetes,high blood pressure,none,Glucophage (Metformin) ,Diabetes-Management,8,Considerably Effective,No Side Effects,850 mg / 500 mg  taken x 3 times a day for the period of 5 years 7 months,the benefits of the treatment were that the blood sugar level that were very high in the beginning of the treatment went to controlled level. (it is controlled with the use of the medicine. I do not know what happens if I stop taking the medicine.)taking the medicine also helps in controlling hunger and so it help in having three meals; on regular times.,was told that the medicine may damage my kidneys and I am taking regular check ups to test kidney function; however after over 5 years of taking the medicine every day (three times a day) there are no side effect and no problems to the kidneys.,the treatment is taking the medicine every day; three times a day for the first three years the dosage I got was of 850 mg twice a day one pill after breakfast and one pill after supper. after three years the dosage was changed a bit and I have received 500 mg three times a day; one pill after each meal. recently (round six months ago) since the blood sugar leveled were under control; the dosage was reduced to 500 mg twice a day after breakfast and after supper 
patient,51,female,diabetes,none,Actos,Glucophage (Metformin) ,Diabetes-Management,7,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1;500/day  (dosage frequency: 2 times per day)  for the period of 3 years,helped lower blood sugar,severe ankle swelling; stomach pain ,Took Metformin (2) times along with Actos. Lowered blood sugar somewhat; but the side effects were terrible. Cut dose back to just Metformin; dropped Actos completely. Along with diet change & excercise it has lowered blood sugar levels I would say 20%
patient,27,male,Insulin Dependent Diabetes Mellitus,None,Insulin Lispro,Lantus (Insulin Glargine) ,Diabetes-Management Diabetes-Management,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,45 units per day  (dosage frequency: twice a day)  for the period of four years; still on going,I experienced markedly improved fasting blood glucose levels; and greater stability of blood sugar before and after meals.  I had found with other treatment options; such as the insulin pump and the nph insulins that my morning blood sugars were always high; even with increased dosages.  ,The only side effects were increased weight gain and increased hypoglycemia in the late evenings/early mornings.  The side effect is because Lantus has a 22 hour duration after injection and as a result whenever I experience a greater than usual amount of activity; my insulin sensitivity increases dramatically.,Treatment consisted of a morning and evening dose of lantus split up as 30 units in the evening and 15 units in the morning.  It took approximately two years of playing with the dosage amounts to find this as the "best fit" as all dosages either resulted in extremely low evening blood sugars or extremely high morning blood sugars.  Also; changes in activity result in severe blood sugar swings as well.

Learned to avoid greasy foods.  I experienced no other side effects.  ,I took a 120mg pill after any meal with fat (2-3 times daily).  It seemed like over time; since my body was aborbing less calories i started to crave less.  The only problem was that without modifying my diet; the weight came back after i quit taking the drug.  It is also expensive; and although it does work I am not sure it is worth the high price.

But you still get the rest of it. What happens with 30% - it comes out and sometimes it is quite an embarrassing experience. Got to control it later; mainly by cutting off food that was reach on fats. Maybe if cut fats alltogether; wouldnt have needed Xenical.

Lost 32 lbs. in 3 months.,One incident of an oily stool.,I took part in a 3-month Obesity/Binge Eating study back in 2004 which included the use of a Placebo or Orlistat (Xenical) conducted by a local Hospital/Medical Center. I would meet with the doctor's weekly and was put on a low-fat diet and asked to do moderate exercise of 30-40 minutes 3 days a week during this study. At the time I was Age 39; 5 ft 7 and 200 lbs. and a cholesterol level of 265 (you had to have a BMI of 30 percent in order to participate in study; and I just made it per the weight and height chart). Half of the study participants were put on a placebo pill and half were put on Orlistat (Xenical). They did not tell the participants during the study if they had the placebo or if they had the Orlistat. At the end of the 3 month study; I lost 32 lbs. (down to 168 lbs.) and my cholesterol went from 265 to 199. I was told at that time I was taking Orlistat. The participants who took Orlistat lost more weight than the ones who took placebo and did the low-fat diet. I can only remember once having what may have been an oily stool. I never had cramps; diarrhea or any type of bowel accidents. It is now 2010; and I have put on 20 lbs. since. I am considering trying to get my family doctor to prescribe Orlistat. I have not heard anything negative about the medication; except for the side effects of oily stools; etc. I believe the people who have experienced the bad side effects are people who are continuing to eat fatty foods (such as pizza; cheeseburgers; etc.) and continue to take the Orlistat. If you follow the directions; you are to eat low-fat and also take a multi-vitamin. I look forward to trying out the Orlistat again. :)

It did not come across as a negative side effect; but I would  cry  on seeing a scenic landscape; not to mention more charged situation.   Similar side effects were described by my friend who also took marvelon.  Moreover; I experienced enhanced libido but; perhaps; it was an effect of reduced worrying over getting pregnant.,I took it daily with with 7-day break each month; during which a period was induced.

Also; it was so uncomfortable that I had to "walk slower" around my apt and I could barely talk as I had to breathe in more carefully so that I could calm my heart down as much as I could. I didn't go to bed until 4/5am because I was so worried that I might have a heart attack! VIAGRA IS REALLY STRONG AND IT'S NOT SOMETHING TO TAKE LIGHTLY!

Levothyroxine treatment alone was not working well.  The combination works much better.,None,Since being diagnosed with hypothyroidism; my doctors would treat with basically the Levothyroxine.  The levels would be increased until I was in the range; but I never felt quite right.  I was still very tired and my memory; especially short-term; was really bad.  I went to a couple endocrinologists; with the first one diagnosing the hypothyroidism as a result of Hashimotos disease.  Even with this diagnosis; the first endocrinologist did not suggest other treatments and I continued to suffer with excessive tiredness and memory problems.  I decided to go for a second opinion; and this endocrinologist told me that some individuals react better with a combination treatment of Levothyroxine and Cytomel.  This seemed to turn me around.  The memory and tiredness have gotten better; still not optimal.  It seems as long as one is in the range; doctors are hesitant to push the envelope.  I would like to see physicians listen to their patients and adjust the meds until they feel better; not just go by the range.

Adding Cytomel fine tuned treatment and all symptoms resolved.,There were none - all I felt was better.,I took 100 mg Levoxyl; which provides a thyroid hormone called T4. It's success depends on the body's ability to convert T4 to T3; adding Cytomel proves T3 (the active hormone) directly. I now take 10 mcg Cytomel along with 100 mg Levoxyl and symptoms of low thyroid have resolved.

The brown spots would be less noticable as long as I was using the cream consistantly.,dry peeling skin; redness. once you stopped using it the blotchiness returned and brown spots returned. I needed to wear alot of sunscreen on my hand after using it on that area because it rendered those areas vulnerable to sun exposure. also while driving I had to wear gloves which blocked sun rays to my hands.,used from a tube mainly at night. Used a pea size amount on each hand and one pea size amount on the face. Used over the lip line and on fine lines under the eye.

In addition; it peeled away old skin at the site.  I used it over small wrinkles and skin lines (without doctor's knowledge).  I was pleased with the results over small skin lines.  These dissapeared or diminished.  The product does not work over face parenthesis or deep wrinkles.  It appeared to me that skin's tone also improved.  The skin also developed a healthy shine.,The side effects as reported are skin redness and sun sensitivity.  I experienced both.  Always use this product with a sun screen or you will burn 10X faster. The product should be used as directed and a little goes a long ways.  I used too much at the beggining (I also left on the product during the day) and my skin got really irritated and peeled.,The product was to be used at bedtime.  To leave on all night and wash in the morning.  The treatment was to continue until acne resolved then use as needed.

In that regards it worked admirably.  Retin A users have a period of almost 3 months where there skin (usually face) is tremendously red.  Tazorac has little of this.  I only would only get this about every 7 days or so and was cured easily with hydrocortisone.,As above; the drug has similar side effects to Retin-A; exept for the fact that they are far less frequent and far less severe.  As above; this effect only occurred about every 7 days or so and was cured easily with hydrocortisone. However; the results were completely worth it; as it eliminated many wrinkles in my skin; and the texture it left behind was much more cosmetically appealing.  ,I purchased a full 60 gram tube.  It was like $10 with my insurance.  I would first wash my face with Neutogena deep facial cleaner.  After letting dry 30 minutes; I would start to apply the Tazorac.  I would dispemse a pea-shaped amount on my finger and then dab my my cheeks; near my eyes; my chin; and my forehead.  Then rub in.  After about another 30 minutes; I would place on moisturizer.

My hands looked worse than anyone else's my age (or older!).  My hands now looks pretty good/very good!,As the age spots scabbed up; they peeled off; and left my hands red; raw and sore.  One night; the burning feeling was so intense; I had to wash it off.  I was quite worried; as this medicine was out of date; and I thought perhaps it had become dangerous.  Originally it was prescribed for my daughter's acne; but I had read online that it might be helpful for age spots.,I applied a small amount; probably more than I needed to; to the back of each hand for several nights in a row.  Before many nights had passed; I noticed that the skin around each age spot was beginning to become dry and peeling.  Before long; the age spots just seemed to peel off; as did some spots that were more like small moles or very dark freckles.  Although I was concerned that I had severly burned and scarred my hands (they looked very bad for more than a month); now they look great.  In fact; the left one; which was the worse one; improved more than the right hand!

It was effective in reducing the outbreak but it does not eliminate or reduce blackheads unless an inordinate amount of ointment is applied daily.,Generally a mild peeling occurred on the areas where the ointment was applied - some itchiness as well but not very often,cleanse with a non abrasive facial cleanser and dry face.

After a while; however; all the symptoms except for the peeling skin and sun sensitivity diminished. ,I applied a pea-sized amount of Tazorac cream once a night before bed; starting in my freshmen year in high school.

This later turned into a burning sensation; which decreased over time.,I was prescribed Tazorac after requesting a Retinol treatment from my doctor. I initially asked for Retin-A; but she suggested Tazorac as it was better suited for my skin type. (Fair; sensitive skin). I initially used the cream every night; but decreased to 3 times a week after experiencing dryness and peeling. I also felt a burning sensation after applying the cream; but this too has subsided. 
patient,30,male,Acne; photoaging,oily skin; acne; wrinkles; photodamage,benzoyl peroxide,Tazorac (Tazarotene Cutaneous) ,Hormones Hormones topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,.1% cream  (dosage frequency: every other day)  for the period of 3 years,This is probably the best skin care product/medicine available. It is highly effective for both acne and photo-aging. It exfoliates the skin better than anything else; thus unclogging the pores. It also speeds up cell turnover; which reduces keratinization; preventing comedo-formation. It smooths out wrinkles; makes the deep layers of skin - dermis - thicker; increases collagen production; etc. You can read about all its benefits on PubMed. It has been proven more effective than tretinoin (Retin A) for both acne and photoaging.,Initially it is quite irritating; that is why it is VERY important to start using it less often and with a smaller applied amount. Do not overdose on Tazorac or else your skin - the upper horny layer; statum corneum - will become so thin and dry that it will crack - thus you will actually CREATE wrinkles rather than eliminate any. If you take it slowly and gradually increase the dose; you won't have that problem; as the skin adjusts to it. You should probably start using it only every 3rd or 4th day initially; gradually increasing to every other day or even every day. Some people are able to use it twice a day; I know I cant. In case you develop severe irritation; you must use a good moisturizer to prevent wrinkle formation. If you are using it for acne; and are using other products such as benzoyl peroxide - as you should; you should be even more careful; as skin irritation is cumulative from the various drugs. You will have to use a lower dose BP such as 2.5% because your skin will be exfoliated and more easily irritated. ,The gel is more effective than the cream; in that it delivers a higher dosage of the medication faster. The cream however has lower side effects and it achieves more controlled release of the drug. I believe the cream is more appropriate for anti-aging; as it is more emollient. Neither the cream nor the gel are comedogenic so acne sufferers should not worry. I have used both the gel and the cream; with both concentrations - .05% and .1%. I am currently using the .1% cream. There is a generic version available from an Indian manufacturer called Glenmark. Their product is called Tazret. It is virtually the same as the original.

I need keep using it to determine whether it will diminish fine lines and wrinkles.  Others say that you need to use it for at lease a month before the side effects diminish.  ,redness; itchiness and peeling.  Wrinkles around eyes actually seem a little worse due to dryness.

I didn't have awful acne; but it was persistent.,When I first began using the product I suffered serious side effects; especially to my neck.  My face became very; very dry and red; and it hurt.  After several weeks of toughing it out; I ended up skipping a nightly dose; and I think that helped.  It allowed my skin to recover a bit so that when I got back on the reginme the following night; I didn't suffer quite as badly.  From that time on; my neck just itched . . . and itched . . . and itched.  After about two weeks; though; my skin acclimated fully.,I was instructed by my dermatologist to wash my face nightly with a benign cleanser; wait twenty to thirty minutes; and then apply a very light film of product to my face and neck.  Be careful not to apply the product directly up against the side of the nose or the nostrils; or you'll suffer irritation.

The skin felt softer and pimples were not prominent.,The side effects associated with the use of Tazorac daily for the treatment of antiaging skin is severe dry skin; erythema or skin redness and severe flaking and burning of the skin. There was quite abit of tingling even after the gel had dried overnight.,The treatment details for the skin gel Tazorac was to apply it once a day; or in my case nightly to the face. Not more than a small pea size of cream was directed however this was quickly absorbed into the skin and could not be applied over the remainging area of the face. Caution was applied in ensuring that the treatment gel was not applied to mucosal areas. Nevertheless it did radiate to areas such as the eyes and lips causing severe dryness and chafing.

I would wash my face and wait 10 minutes so the skin was completely dry for application. I applied the cream to the cheek area and spread outward trying to avoid the sensitive corners of the mouth; nose & eyes. I decreased the amount when I began to get some peeling and then took a break from treatment when I got obvious irritation. At this point; the treatment has to be on and off a schedule to avoid the side effects.

Truly turned back time.  Visible results within weeks and first 2 months were remarkable; but over the last year; the benefits have continued and areas of brown discoloration I thought would need laser therapy are almost cleared up!  I also had some scar dents that have cleared up and/or mostly gone!,and sometimes; like when I travelled to dry locations; I had to stop treatment temporarily ; or had severely dry and peeling skin.

This was expected according to directions. ,the only side effects were a little irritability of the skin around the nose and eyes. Maybe because some product gets trapped in the deeper wirinkles in that area; so must be careful to distribute evenly. ,I am very delighted with the medecine; to the point where I feel addicted to it and don't ever want to go without it again.

I tried over-the-counter lubricants including suppositories but found them to be inconsistent and they also masked sensitivity in the vaginity area.,Vagifem has little side effects. I occasionally notice some discharge. I also feel bloated for a day or so after inserting.,The small tablet is inserted vaginally twice a week. It's recommended that you do so at the same time of day. Twice a week is somewhat difficult to keep track of. Does that mean every 3 days or every 4 days? It involves marking treatment down on a calendar to maintain a regular schedule.

I had 5 rounds of treatment; though I'm not sure why the doctor chose to try this many times when none of the early tries were successful.  Some stimulation occurred - 7-10 follicles were stimulated with each treatment - but conception did not occur.,Visual disturbances (flashing light effects; blurring); mood swings; fluid retention.,Clomid was given on days 3-7 of the menstrual cycle; one 50 mg pill by mouth per day; at the same time each day.  Follicle progress was subsequently tracked via ultrasound.  Side effects were minimal with the first round of treatment; more severe with the 2nd onward.  I have no known allergies or sensitivities to other medications; other than topical iodine.

It triggers the ovaries to ripen more ovuls and to invrease the change of conceiving.,bluuring vision; moodiness; depression; panic attacks; weight gain; skin problems,Starting with the first day of menstruation as  day 1; a daily dose of 150 mg is taken from day 5 to 9 of the monthly cycle. Chlomiphene citrate does first suppress estrogen in the womens body therefore the body reacts with an increased effort to build estrogen. After day 9 the increased effort to build estrogen comes  effectiv in the ovaries producing more ovuls.
patient,41,female,female problems; trying to get pregnant; ovulation,none,none,Clomid (Clomiphene) ,Infertility,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,50 mg once daily for five days  taken 1 a day for the period of 3 months,One thing that Clomid does is aids in maturing the eggs.. many women ovulate; but the eggs that are released aren't reaching "full maturity" beforehand. An egg that isn't "mature" usually cannot be fertilized...this was part of my case (Clomid certainly does other things to aid in getting pregnant and ovulating; etc). I took Clomid for YEARS. Conceived my daughter on Clomid the first month (she's now 13 yrs old); but also took it for years after that with no luck....eventually got pg with no outside help.,menstrual bleeding; including spotting between periods or long; heavy periods -- up to 1.3 percent. ,My starting Clomid dose was 50 mg once daily for five days. The Clomid dosage was increased to 100 mg and ovulation occured. My doctor will helped me to determine that ovulation has occurred using an ultrasound. 
patient,36,female,infertility,not ovulating; low hormones,asprin to thin blood,Clomid (Clomiphene) ,Infertility,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,One tablet a day  taken daily; orally for the period of 2 years,Increased my estrogen levels; started ovulating again; and after about 6 months my ovulation formed a predictable pattern with an ending menstrual period. It was an easy small sized capsule to swallow and did not break down in water. Once ovulation was kicked off and preganancy still did not occur; it allowed my obstetrician to focus on other possible problems.,Initially there were no problems; but after a week or so; began to suffer from blurred vision; which would appear and disappear at random. Hot flushes would also be sporadic. I also had a sense of "scatterbrain" ie my mind felt jumbled up; I could not make quick decisions; everything seemed blurry in my head. My stomach suffered from bloating  and a sense of squirmishness.  On some days I vomitted.Over time this decreased; and eventually after 1 and 1/2 years these symptons stopped. The time line probably could be reduced; but on ocassions of sickness; I stopped taking clomid and began the next month. My skin had a positive impact - it was very clear and had a very soft feel/texture. I had a very heightened sense of smell as well.,After a first successful pregnancy; my attempts at a second were not succeeding. Medical tests showed my ovulation hormones were very low and my period was very erratic and sometimes non existant. This coincides with my history of polycistic ovariaries. A dosage of Clomid was initiated with the aim of increasing hormones to correct levels; produsing measurable ovulation and resulting regular menstrual periods. Clomid caused some quite uncomfortable side effects initially ie dizziness; vomitting; unclear mental thoughts and stomach sensitivity; which onoccassons sent me to bed for recovery. Over time as my body absorbed clomid and adjusted to the hew level of hormones; the side effects stopped. Whilst not inducing a pregancy; it allowed my obstercian to focus on other possible problems. Overall; Clomid did exactly what it is designed to do - stimulate ovulation. I would recommend its use.

Taking a whole pill gave me relief but also a light headed sensation and odd heartbeat. I bit the pills in two to take approx. 50mg.  Gradually my system became inured to it's effects and I had to take the whole pill; also occasionally it just doesn't work anymore.  I have long lasting recurring headaches and have always been worried about overuse and rebound headaches; but so far; so good.

patient,48,female,migrain,arthritis,diclofenac sodium,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,50mg  taken when a migraine was coming on for the period of 10 years,As soon as I felt a migraine coming on; I would feel very tired and feel dizzy at first and then the headache would come a little later. As soon as I could feel the headache I would take one tablet and within half an hour to an hour the headache would go and I would feel a lot better but still a little odd; a not quite 'here' feeling,I don't think I have any side effects as such but I usually feel a little odd and very tired after a migraine but not sure if that is the after effects of the migraine or a side effect of taking Imigran. Before I was given these by my doctor my migrains lasted for 3 days with severe headache and nausea.,My doctor told me to take one as you feel a migraine coming on; if it does not work it is not worth taking another one but this rarely happens. If the headache goes but comes back I can take another one; I tend to do this if the attack is servere; I might need to take two or even three over two or three days but generally I find one tablets works. I have been taking it for approx 10 years or so.

I was in pain for about 14 hours when I was taken to a little emergency clinic. They gave me an injection of 50 miligrams and in about 15 minutes I was pain free and feeling normal.,Sometimes a little queasiness if taken on an empty stomach.  Sometimes a little fatigue and a feeling of slight slowness.,I take the Imitrex by mistake for a headache that is not a migraine I get queasy and tight in the stomach and feel hung over.

Imitrex just isn't right for me.  I experienced almost all of the side effects such as flushing; sensations of tingling/prickling; weakness; drowsiness; dizziness; and fast/pounding heartbeat.  On top of that the packaging is just HORRIBLE!  It comes 9 to a package.  The packaging is a tri-fold "booklet" that is very rigid and has individual blisters for each tablet.  It's about 6 1/2 by 3 1/2 inches; folded.  I  like to have migraine meds on me at all times so I ended up cutting the tablets out of the booklet so they would fit in my wallet or purse.  Definitely going back to Axert!,flushing; tingling; prickling; weakness; drowsiness; dizziness and pounding heartbeat.,Take 1 tablet by mouth. Max 2 tabs per 24 hours.

I have no side effects from the taking this medicine.,None,You can only take this medicine while not driving. You have to be able to go into a dark room and be able to lay for at least and hour and half. After that you are able to go back to normal living.

I have had severe headaches most of my adult life- Imitrex takes the headaches away.  The only downside is that the drug causes me to be a bit drousy.,See above,I take the drug at the onset of a headache.  Within 10 minutes; the headache symptoms disappear

I have suffered with chronic severe migraines since the age of 4 with severe nausua resulting in 3 to 4 emergency room visits per month. I missed so much school; work and family events that I became unrealiable which later brought on depression. I still suffer today 44 years later with them but they are not as severe and I can now function in life somewhat normal. Imitrex gave me a chance to live my life the way I wanted to!,Usually a feel of tiredness 10 to 12 hours after initial dose which can last up to 24 hours. Taking one dose of the pill has less effects of tiredness then taking the 6mg shot or taking them both within a 24hr period. ,After over the counter medications failed to relieve headache pain I could tell if the headache was triggering a migraine and at that time take the imitrex pill and the migraine would be totally gone within 30 minutes. If the migraine was to strong with nausea symptoms and the pill didn't work; I would then take a imitrex 6mg shot for almost instant relief including nausea. Very rarely will the imitrex not work and then I have to go to emergency room.

No one should have to suffer with migraines anymore.,I have not had any side effects.,Decribed above.

Then Imitrex--a miracle!  Imitrex; finally; gave me my life back. As I get older and am now retired (72) and have less stress; I use the stat dose once or never during the year. The 50mg tablet usually returns me to normal within an hour. A "generic" has become available but is less Imitrex and more Naprosin; an anti-inflammatory;  which is cheaper for the manufacturer but not good long-term for the patient. My doctor is keeping me on the brand name. However; Humana has dropped Imitrex coverage; not wanting to pay the high cost; which never gets lower as the manufacturer won't release the patent.  Now I'm worried; having to pay the entire cost myself; which is impossible.  It's a horrible dilemma.  I can't pay for it and they won't.  What now?,I have had no side effect at all; and I have been taking Imitrex since it came on the market.,I don't know what you mean by "details."

I suffered from severe headaches for years before finally consulting with a neurologist.  Imitrex was life changing because I no longer worried about getting a migraine; which in turn reduced the number I was getting!,Tingling in the back of my head and hands.  Warm; strange feeling when running hands under water.  All last for a short time and are well worth the relief.,Very simple - Take one pill when I felt like a migraine was coming on.

I would need to take the pills before getting sick to stomach; because if after; I could not keep pills down.  The shot worked regardless of when I took it.
patient,24,female,Migraines,N/A,N/A,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,100 Mg  taken 2-3 times per week for the period of 2 years,Relieves a migraine 8 out of 10 times.,Strange tingling sensations; a 'floaty' feeling; occasional stomach ache,Sometimes it makes me feel really weird for awhile afterwards; but it is worth it to calm the pounding in my head. I've had migraines since kindergarten and only recently discovered Imitrex. I never knew there was actually a pill that would take away a migraine. I think they cause rebound headaches; and they're ridiculously expensive; but it's more than worth it in the moment.
patient,42,female,Migraine,none,none,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,25mg  taken once per month for the period of 7 years,Pain relief that was seen within 30 minutes.  If migraine was not reduced then a second 25 mg tablet is taken after the 30 minutes.,Mild dizziness and a rushing feeling sometimes occurs.  I am not comfortable driving after having taken Imitrex and will generally stay at home that day.,As stated above; a 25 mg pill is taken at the onset of the migraine; followed by a second dose if pain is not reduced.
patient,48,female,Migraine,none,aleve,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,100 mg  taken once a day/ sometimes 2 for the period of cluster headaches- 4-5 months a time,Once a day; sometimes 2 in a 24 hour period depending on the severe headache,none,I have had migraines since I was 9 years old. Through JR high I would finish a bottle of aspirin in a week and a half. About every 3 or 4 days they were horrible with nausea ; cold pack on my head; stay out of the light. About 9 years ago I developed cluster migraines. They last all day; nite for 4-5 months. I was introduced to imitex in 2005. THANK GOD!!!  They have been increasing in cost terribly. I went through sinus aerials; allergy tests; bio feed back. etc. Nothing helped. I thought I would take my life when these clusters started. Not only could I not function but I had to sleep sitting up. Lying dowm made them worse.  I have no side effects.  But the imitrex is not working as well and I take aleve with it. Treximet is not strong enough.  
patient,50,female,migraines,NONE,NONE,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,50 mg  taken as needed for migraines for the period of for last 15 years,If I have a classical migraine; I cannot function without taking an Imitrex. Imitrex takes the edge off the pain; takes away the feeling of nausea and I am able to work on the computer; which I otherwise could not do with a migraine. The pills work most of the time but do not work if the headache was not a migraine. The drug used to have an effect quicker on me several years ago when it took care of my migraine within 30 minutes. Today it often takes me an hour to feel better after taking Imitrex.,I usually feel really tired and depressed the next day after haven taken Imitrex. I feel the drug depresses all systems. It takes off the edge of the pain; but still leaves a dull feeling in the head. ,I take an imitrex within an hour of onset of a migraine headache. However; I do not take more than one Imitrex per day. Also; I usually do not take it two days in a row; if I don't have to; as the drug makes me feel very tired and depressed the next day.
patient,61,female,migraine headaches,none,none,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,25mg (50mg cut in-half)  taken can be up to 15-20 times a month for the period of I have been taking it for about 14 years,I was able to completely stop a migraine from happening once I felt one starting.  This has been extremely beneficial to me.  I have gotten my life back.  I would have 1-2 migraines a week which would put me in bed for 2 days.  I would take pain killers; which only knocked me out; doing nothing to alleviate the pain.  I was missing a large part of my life; being in bed.  Also I never knew when I would have to cancel plans or stay home from work due to a migraine.  I felt very unreliable; which is not me.  I am a very responsible person.,I have never had any negative side effects from Imitrex.  ,I take half of a tablet at the first sign that a migraine is starting.  Usually within 45-60 minutes the beginning symptoms of my migraine are gone.  Once in awhile; at this point (60 minutes after I have taken half of a tablet) the symptoms are not noticeable different; so I will take another half of a tablet.

I found I needed to take the pill at the very first inkling of a headache coming on.  If I waited until the migraine was full blown; a second pill would be needed at the appropriate time.  If caught early; one pill would make the migraine go away
patient,36,female,Migraine headaches,nausea; dry heaving,none,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,2,Ineffective,Mild Side Effects,1 tablet at onset of pain  taken 2-3 times a month for the period of 8 times in a 3 month period,The drug did absolutely nothing for the pain or to lessen the time of the migraine.  The migraines were usually sseveral days long.,I experienced slightly more gagging while dry heaving and nausea changed to sickening feeling and more stomach churning.,Took Imitrex for a 3 month period and still had no noticeable results.  The tablet was suppose to lessen the pressure and pain if taken at onset of migraine.  I ended up trying Aleve and still take it to this day for migraines.  
patient,60,female,Migraine headaches,None,Lopressor; Effexor,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,6,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,100 mg  taken every day for the period of 10 years,Imitrex usually reduced the headache severity; if I was able to take it at the first sign of a headache. If I took it later; Imitrex might help somewhat but often not enough.,I was often tired after a severe headache. Otherwise; I didn't notice too many side effects.,I built up an immunity to the effects of Imitrex. I took them more often and needed to take more of them. I was eventually taking nearly 3 per day. It was extremely expensive; and the bigger issue is that such a high dosage isn't good long term. It was hell breaking the addiction!
patient,18,female,daily migraines 2-3 times a day,none,topimax and amitriptyline ,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,100mg  taken when i felt a migraine comming on for the period of once,nothing has worked in relieving my migraine pain but I took imitrex when I felt a migraine comming on and within a half hour my migraine was completely gone,I felt extremely dizzy; I was short of breath and my throat felt constricted. I also felt an almost floating sensation for a while after I took it and I was in bed all day with the side effects,take one pill at the onset of a headache and if it doesn't go away you can take another but you can't take more than two in 24hrs
patient,59,female,migraine headaches,none,none,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,50 mg  taken as needed for the period of 10 years,Imitrex has been a godsend.  After years of suffering pain and interruption of life due to migraines; just one little pill; either at the onset of pain or even when migraine is full-blown and pain is reliefed within 30 minutes.,I have experienced no side effects with Imitrex.,At the onset of pain or even if migraine is full-blown; take one tablet with water and lie down if possible. Pain is reliefed within 30 minutes.  Only rarely; a second dose may be required if pain is very intense.
patient,65,female,migraine,neck pain and muscle spasms,methocarbamol,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,8,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1 shot  (dosage frequency: once every 1 or 2 weeks)  for the period of it is continuous over 10 years,my migraines would always leave after taking imitrex or sumatriptan and then if taken at night i could go back to sleep and sleep through the night and wake feeling just fine.,I found that my blood veins would stick out all down my arms and hands during the next days after the treatment and that these veins would be very painful.  there was an ache throughout my arms and sometimes in my legs due to this sumatriptan. , the optimum time for the shot is at bedtime and this is when I would take the shot and immediately lie down. my heart would race just after taking the shot and i would feel pain shooting through my body. but i have always found that the headace left EXCEPT if i had the shots too close together in that this seemed to stir up the headache for some reason.
patient,46,female,Migraine,None,None,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,8,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,1 100MG tablet  taken as needed for the period of As needed,I have taken Imitrex off and on for over 15 years. I have migraine headaches. Typically one tablet of Imitrex gets rid of the headache; usually within 30 minutes. ,Side effects seem to vary. Sometimes I have body aches (almost flu like) for an hour or so. There is also sometimes flushing. I do become fatigued. Within four hours; all side effects (and the migraine!) are gone.,One pill is taken at the onset of the migraine. I have only needed an additional pill (taken 4-5 hours after in initial pill) once or twice in the fifteen years I have been taking the drug.
patient,51,female,migraine,anxiety,metoprplol,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,5,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,100 mg  taken as needed for the period of 17 years,used to only get migraines once or twice a month.,is the bad for me. Since taking imitrex; the frequency of migraines have increased. I got rebound from this drug everytime I use it. It'ts totally ridiculous to find a drug that gets rid of the pain but I cannot use it anymore due to it's effect on frequency. I've tried all the other triptans and only imitrex has worked for me but I can no longer take it.,Again about the rebound effect. Some doctors refuse to admit that this drug causes rebound headaches but for me it did. I took nothing else...no OTC drugs or anything else for the headach. ONLY the imitrex. When I realized what was happening I stopped taking drug and just suffer through as I used to. That's the bad...the good is frequency of mograines are much less. 
patient,20,female,Migrane,none,none,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,1,Marginally Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,100mg  taken once for the period of once,My migraine intensed but then subsided within 2 hours of taking this medication.,When you receive this medication it comes with a patient information pamphlet giving each side effect for the drug and i experienced every side effect there was. At first I experienced heat flushes; then slight muscle spasms; 45 minutes into this drug's effect I experienced a tightness in my neck. This scared me because i thought i was having an intense allergic reaction to the drug. Then; there was a lot of pressure in my head so i then took an Aleve and that pretty much eased everything out. I will never take this medication again.,Was given once for a migraine treatment option.
patient,19,female,Migraine,Other allergies,Birth Control,Imitrex (Sumatriptan) ,Migraine Selective-Serotonin-Agonists Vasoconstrictor-Agents,1,Ineffective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,10mg  taken as needed for the period of once,none,Within 30 minutes of taking my first dose of imitrex (on Christmas eve) when I felt the onset of my migraine; I began to feel a heavy; cramping feeling in my muscles like I had slept the wrong way. Then my back began to ache and my joints began to cramp up and throb. My chest felt heavy and I had trouble breathing and remembering to breath. My throat and neck hurt so back and it felt like i had strained it or pulled a muscle. My train of thought was messed up and I could not concentrate or form full comprehensive sentences. There was nothing I could do so I just waited it out; towards the end (nearly 4 hours later) I tried eating and my salivary glands went crazy! I felt like I was drinking and eating scalding hot food; it was crazy! I will NEVER take that again. I called my doctor and she moved me immediately to MAXALT; IT IS GREAT; I LOVE IT. I have other allergies so it is no surprise to me that I had a reaction; but the severity was shocking. Don't settle for a medication that makes you feel only half good.,Took when then on set of a migraine was felt.

I get one every couple of months or so. I have to say that I sort of dread taking the Imitrex because I do experience several side effects; but it usually gets rid of the headache so it winds up being a catch 22. I really hate the muscle aches and weird tight feeling in my head and face. The increase in heart rate can freak me out too; especially if my thyroid meds have just been bumped up too.,Side effects for me include: Heaviness in my limbs; muscle aches; tight feeling in head; flushing; increased heart rate; drowsiness.,Take 100 mg at first indication of migraine. May repeat dosage after 2 hours if pain isn't relieved. Thereafter; only 1 may be taken in a 24 hour period.

When I first began taking the medication; I slept ALL the time--as much as 22 hours a day.  I literally could not stay awake.  This may have been due not only to the drug's sedating affect; but to the vast sleep deficit of that years of pain and insomnia had produced.  As time went on; I slept less; and was less dependent on the Baclofen as a "maintenance" medication--I began to "save" it to take in slightly more concentrated doses when a severe muscle spasm or strain; or a "flare" occurs; which happens frequently in fibromyalgia patients.  I have noticed that the drug is less effective than it used to be; requiring higher doses to treat the same level of stiffness or cramping.

I tried every migraine medication on the market.  Either they didn't have any effect; or I was unable to tolerate them due to side-effects.  With Botox injections administered by a very knowledgable neurologist who is also a pain specialist; I am virtually migraine-free for months.,Sometimes I had some minor swelling at an injection site.  It went away within days.,My neurologist injects the tiny cranial muscles as well as muscles along my neck and upper shoulder.  He uses a tiny needle and injects very little at each site.  He determines where the trigger points are before administering the Botox.  PLEASE NOTE:  If using Botox for migraines; do go to a neurologist who is experienced with migraine pain.  DO NOT have this done by a cosmetic surgeon!

They started reappearng after about three months. I looked younger. I also didnt look look like i was frowning all of the time.  ,The initital injection was very painful. I had a very bad headache for about two days after the treatment. Also after about a year of the treatments i started noticing lines on the sides of my forehead; which my doctor said was unrelated to the botox; but i know someone else who got them as well.,The treatment consisted of injected 2 syringes; one on each side of the furrows lines on my forehead. The doctor said I could also have them injected on the sides of the eyes but i opted not to. Probably because of the pain.

Very pleased with the outcome.,Minimal; but sometimes mild head aches occured for short period of time.,Injections in local area: 20 - 30 units per treatmentat 6 - 8 mth intervals.  Always administered by qualified professional.  Expensive; but well worth it.
patient,42,female,wrinkles,none,none,Botox (Botulinum Toxin Type A) ,Muscle-Relaxants Muscle-Relaxants Ophthalmic-Preparations Ophthalmic-Preparations,6,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,40 vials  (dosage frequency: every 6 months)  for the period of every 6 months,Wrinkles did disapear; but there was bruising and swelling. It did reduce after a few days; and I noticed the inability to move the muscles in my forehead and around my mouth. ,Bruising and swelling. Not sure if it was the way the injections were delivered or because of my tendency to bruise.,The vials were injected around my mouth; eyes; and on the forhead. The effect did last for several months; but I had not been happy about the side effects.
patient,47,female,Facial lines,none,none,Botox (Botulinum Toxin Type A) ,Muscle-Relaxants Muscle-Relaxants Ophthalmic-Preparations Ophthalmic-Preparations,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,50cc  (dosage frequency: every 4 months)  for the period of Ongoing,General anti aging effects on the face.

patient,50,female,for wrinkle (line) reduction,none,multivitamins,Botox (Botulinum Toxin Type A) ,Muscle-Relaxants Muscle-Relaxants Ophthalmic-Preparations Ophthalmic-Preparations,5,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,100 units  (dosage frequency: one time injection of 100units;)  for the period of 1 time 100u; 2 x 50 units; 10 u x 1,Botox was administered to help reduce the lines appearing on my forehead and at the outer side of my eyes- crows feet.  The 100 and 50 unit injections were effective in reducing the lines for a period of about 5 months; but there were noticeable adverse reactions with the 100 units.  The 50 units were as effective but without the spasms noted under Treatment Details.  OF the 2 times 50 units were injected;  the last time the botox had been reconstituted for more than the recommended 4 hours.  There was concern of effectiveness; but actually it seems as though the botox was more quickly effective; and seemed more effective in reducing the lines that the previous 50 unit injection.  More detail is covered under the treatment details., Side effects were twitching of eyes; especially upon smiling;;; spasms of cheeks.  Blurry vision.  This lasted for approximately 3 days.,MAIN CONCERN is :  if physicians; agents  have only 50 - 100unit vials available; and they are only injecting 1 client; what do they do with the residual.  Is this why there is such a high cost  $11 - $15 per unit??  It makes me wonder if physicians are freezing or using the botox beyond the 4 hour expiration time.  Have manufacturers ever thought of packaging smaller unit packages to assure clients are getting "the real" stuff.  This last physician did not have the manufacturer's bottle for me to see; only a small syringe already pre-filled.

patient,39,female,back injury,na,na,Soma (Carisoprodol) ,Muscle-Relaxants Muscle-Relaxants,5,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,350mg  taken 1 tablet 4 times daily for the period of 2 weeks,Minimized pain immediatley and made back injury seem non-existant,Could not remember doing things.  ALmost like being in a time warp.  Not good to take this medication unsupervised.,Have a bulging disc.  I was given Carisoprodol to relieve the pain.  I took the medication for 2 weeks.  I actually needed it much longer but the side effects were too intense.  This medication does relieve pain but in no way cures injury.
care giver,42,female,Broken Ribs,Bi-Polar disorder,Wellbutrin Soma changed to Flexril 10 mg,Soma (Carisoprodol) ,Muscle-Relaxants Muscle-Relaxants,2,Ineffective,Moderate Side Effects,500mg ;   taken when needed / every four hours for the period of 1  month,The Wellbutrin at times causes confusion in thought transfer.,The Wellbutrin at times causes confusion in thought transfer.,No Activity for six weeks as patient was a truckdriver for a living and fell in the bathroom at home and broke her rib.  It was floating around and lung puncture was the greatest concern.  The Flexril made the patient relax to almost oblivion therefore disabling her ability to move around.  The Wellbutrin was for bipolar disorder and was taken twice a day for at least a year and prior to that Cymbalta which she said gave her gas.
patient,44,male,back pain,none,none,Soma (Carisoprodol) ,Muscle-Relaxants Muscle-Relaxants,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,350mg  taken every 6 hrs for the period of 3 days,The pain in my back and neck caused stress and spasms. The medication relived the pain ; nearly completlly; and allowed the spasms to subside. I tried anti inflamatories before for this re occuring problem and found them to be nearly useless. Strong pain killers like darvocet and vicadin are affective but do not allow me to maintain any normal activity during the drug use.,I found that after two to three doses ther seems to be a cumulative affect of the drug on my sense of balance. This is very mild; and only leaves me feeling a bit light headed at times. I am still able to engage in most of my normal neccessary activities around my home. I do refrain from driving or any other possibly risky activity when on this medication. Also ; when I have prolonged pain and require several days of medication; I have noticed slight constipation. This is no where near as bad as the constipation caused by vicoden or darvocet. ,I suffered form damage to soft tissues on my neck and back from an accedent. i crashed on a mountain bike and after the inisial recovery period; I found that certain activited can cause a sharp pain in my back at the base of my neck. This; if not medicated; will grow in the course of a hours; into spasms and tense pain. It will cause me to contort my neck and everything I do brings more pain and discomfort. The medication when taken at the onset of the pain; cause the muscles to relax and the pain to subside in a day. If the pain becomes severe and medication is postponed; it may take several doses of medication over the next day or two to make the muscles relax.
patient,52,female,migraines/upper back pain,none,vicodin,Soma (Carisoprodol) ,Muscle-Relaxants Muscle-Relaxants,1,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,350 mg.   taken several times a day for the period of at least a year,None really.  At the beginning it did relieve the pain and helped me to sleep.  ,It wasn't long until I became physically and psychologically dependant on the drug and the treatment became much worse than the problem for which it was prescribed.  Soma is listed as a muscle relaxant which is quite misleading. Because it has been cleverly marketed; it is readily prescribed (or was) and very accessible. I think many pain management physicians prescribe soma for their patients without much thought as to the risks.  The major adverse affects is the rapid tolerance developement and short term memory loss.  There were a number of times that I'd forgotten if /or how much I had taken; which on one occasion precipitated an emergency room visit. It should be classified as a schedule 2 drug at least because of the potential for abuse and overdose. I think this drug should be taken off of the market. ,There aren't any treatment details.  The pain management physician prescribed the medication each monthly visit and increased the dosage not long after introducing the drug as treatment.  These kinds of physicians are really drug dealers cloaked in an DEA approved office.

The effects are felt after about 1 hour; and full effects are felt after 1 1/2 hours; and about 80% of the pain and tension are relieved for about 4-6 hours.

If the medicine is taken before bed; morning pain and tension are reduced about 50%.,Drowsiness (moreso when already tired). If the medicine is taken after 8-10 hours of sleep the drowsiness is manageable. If the medicine is taken after not much sleep; the drowsiness interferes with functioning. ,The medicine is taken once per day at night; about 2 hours before bed. Once the medicine fully kicks in (after about 1 1/2 hours); special stretches are done. Stretching along with the medicine provides about 90% relief from pain and tension; and the relief lasts longer than medicine alone. The medicine is also taken as when pain and tension are worse than average.

The Flexeril was effective in relaxing my muscles enough to make this merely a slight sensation within about twenty minutes; and over aperiod of one two two months the problem went away entirely.,I do not feel that I experienced any truly negative side effects or have any adverse reactions to the Flexeril.  If I was tired; the muscle relaxing effect would end up making me sleepy; and if I took it right before going to sleep it might be a little harder to wake up in the morning. But; to me it seems like that just meant it was doing what it was intended to do.,I was prescribed Flexeril (10mg) for a muscle spasm in my neck that was pinching a nerve to my right arm.  I took the ten miligrams of Flexeril three times a day for about a month as needed as it was prescribed.

patient,27,female,Tension in jaw and Bruxism (grinding of teeth),None,Adderall 10 1/2mg; Maxalt 5mg (take for migraines) and Albuteral Sulfate (only when needed) ,Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine) ,Muscle-Relaxants Tricyclic-Antidepressants,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,5mg - before bedtime  taken bedtime (6-8 hours before waking) for the period of 1 week,I woke up with a more relaxed jaw. I have bruxism which is the medical term for the grinding of teeth or the clenching of jaws. So if I have alot of tension in my jaw before I go to bed I will grind my teeth which will lead to migraines. Taking Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) before I go to bed helps me avoid waking up in pain due to Bruxism. ,I have only had one side effect due to mixing Cyclobenzaprine(Flexeril) with Maxalt which lead to being fatigue and drowsiness.,It has been only 1 week of taking Cyclobenzaprine so I may experience different side effects the more I take it. So far this medication has worked for me. I did notice one very positive benefit from taking this medication this 1 week. I started this medication around the same time I start to get PMS symptoms "Mainly very moody and argumentative" and I'm amazed how Cyclobenzaprine effected my PMS symptoms. I have absolutely been the most pleasant person to be around.  It feels great to be myself and not angry at everything. 
patient,48,female,Inflamed neck muscles,None,An anti inflamatory drug,Flexeril (Cyclobenzaprine) ,Muscle-Relaxants Tricyclic-Antidepressants,9,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,Ten mg.   taken once a day at bedtime for the period of Two weeks,This muscle relaxer allowed me to sleep at night and wake up without a stiff neck. I was not in pain any longer at night. ,It made me groggy in the morning. After a few days this side effect seemed to go away.,I had tweaked my neck muscles and was in a lot of pain.

Pain reliever was effective in numbing the sensation initially; but after 2 days relief was found. 4 days was far better and 6-7 stopped taking every day.,Drowsiness was an issue; but this did improve the sleep time which reduced stress and allowed blood pressure to lower.  I do not like to take medicine; but I can see how easy it is to rely on these to feel relaxed and numb!  It is frightening when I hear about people taking these every night and not think about treating underlying cause of muscle tension.,The two medicines were used in tandem to offset the excrutiating pain in neck and shoulders due to muscles spasms. Chiropractic care was also used; but the pain was equivalent to childbirth contractions and after two days of no sleep and increased stress; medicine was sought.  The medicine took another two days to offer relief that allowed sleep; but after 4 days the muscles were relaxed. Chiropactic care continued and yoga was restarted to resolve the underlying problems. After 6-7 days medication was stopped. 1 night of the following week required medication; but since; none needed.

Usually it gets worse in the cold season. I have tried many other medicines; but they either have too much side effect; or don ,as any other drugs that suppress the immune system; I believe the fluticasone Propionate nasal spray is also make people more susceptible to infections than health individuals.

It cleared the congestion for the a few hour after the first time I used it. I keep using it twice a day. for about five days and my nose became much less stuffy and less runny.

After about 2 weeks of daily use of the nasonex; his headaches were occurring siginificantly less often and he felt much relief.

Lumigan contains the same active ingredient that Latisse will contain when it is released but the difference is that Lumigan is prescribed as a glaucoma medication while Latisse will be marketed and sold as an eyelash growth product.  It does work.  ,I developed dark under eye circles; itching; redness and a slight headache after each use but I was told that the under eye circles and headaches I experienced were less common side effects.  Once the treatment was stopped all of the side effects disappeared including the dark under eye circles. Also; once the treatment is stopped the eyelashes eventually return to their original state.,I was told to use it once a day at night and to apply it with clean brush.  It is important to try to keep the bottle from having direct contact with the skin in order to avoid contamination.  I used a new eyelash brush daily and Latisse contains once a day applicators.

Every second evening I also brushed the solution on the underside of the lashline on my upper eyelid by pulling my eyelid up (being careful not to get it in my eyes).

Other than that there was occasioanlly a very slight burning.,I painted a small amount of Lumigan on the upper and lower lashline every night for a week and then every other night thereafter.

I didn't need to use as much mascara. ,I got itchy eyelids. The itching was fairly mild. ,I put a drop of lumigan on an upside down teacup. Then I applied lumigan with a very fine artists type paintbrush. I would paint a thin line just above the lashes on top and just below the lashes on bottom. I would then use the remainder on my eyebrows. After about 6 weeks I noticed my lashes were longer and thicker. I washed the paintbrush carefully after each use and was careful to keep the line thin. After the first week; I began to use it every other night.

Drug was being used to stem the development of glacoma.    ,treatment was only to right eye; lashes got noticeable thicker,glacoma was hard to diagnose because the cornea was thicker than the norm and the normal puff test gave incorrect readings for several years. I had been diagnosed with type 2 diabetes in 2002 when my weight had reached 397 poounds.  I had also been diagnosed with adult onset asthma when we moved to Oregon in the early 90's.  With the type 2 diabetes; my Dr recommended that I consider gastric bypass surgery which was done at OHSA; Portland OR in October 2002.  My A1c tests started showing normal in 6 months and have remained so since then.  My Dr in Portland had told me to always get my eyes checked by an Opthamologist because of the long term effects of the asthma drugs I had been taken as well as diabetes.

My eye pressure was in the mid 20's and has dropped to the mid teen's. As an experiment; I stopped taking lumigan for several months and my pressure went back up over 20; so I went back on lumigan and it again dropped to the mid teen's. The preferred range of eye pressure is 10 to 20; with 15 or below considered to be optimal.

Long distance vision gradually cleared and returned to near normal.  After an additional three weeks the itchiness is continuing to reduce and the distance vision is continuing to improve.  Eyes are still itchy but I have gone from putting over-the-counter eye drops in my eyes more than 10x during an eight hour period to about 2x during an eight hour period.  I have improved from barely being able to read the top line of the eye chart to almost normal vision.,Severe burning sensation in eyes about one minute after applying drops.  This burning sensation did not always occur.  When the burning sensation occurred my eyes were photosensitive so I had to remain in a dark room for about 15 minutes.  I wore dark glasses for about one hour after leaving the dark room.  I put the eye drops in my eyes in the morning and before going to bed at night.  This meant some mornings I would be leaving for work at 6am (quite dark out) with dark glasses on as any amount of light was painful.  ,Had very dry itching eyes.  Difficult to determine if part was allergies.  Was referred to retinal specialist by my eye physician because of severely decreased vision.  Specialist prescribed the restasis and some different eye drops.  Returned in about 6 weeks with distinctly better vision but continued burning and itchy eyes.  Am to continue treatment and return in another six weeks.  Have noticed a reduction in itchiness since last visit and a small improvement in distance vision.

Without insurance expect to pay between $270 - $300 for a month supply; depending on which pharmacy you use.  Even with insurance it costs me $68 a month.  If you read the insert that comes with the drops it states that clinical trials show only 15% of patients show improvement.  Had I read that BEFORE I wasted the money on 3 montjs worth of this stuff I wouldn't have even bothered.  Waste of money!

Both issues disappeared when I started taking restsis.  There was a short period where I ran out of restasis and stopped; after about a week the dry eye symptoms had reappeared; only to do away when I resumed treatment.,there were not any side effects.  ,1-2 eye drops twice a day

However; when I stopped  using them for a month the dry eye problem was bad enough to make me realize they had been helping enough to make me realize I was better off with them than without. I continue to use them.,I had no side effects except some slight burning once in a while when I put them in my eye.,I was to put one drop in each eye in the morning and again in the evening.
patient,35,male,Depression,none,none,Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) ,Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents,7,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,100mg   taken once a day for the period of 6 months,The drug helped to lift me out of the worst part of the depression; but it's not a complete cure. ,and Diaohhrea. Swings between the two which is really annoying.,No medication is a complete cure for depression. I had tried at least half a dozen other medications before we settled on this one.
patient,52,female,Depression,anxiety,xanax,Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) ,Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,50mg  taken once daily for the period of I have been taking this drug for 6 month,This is an NSRI; different from an SSRI because it works on more than one brain chemical. When an SSRI is ineffective or a patient finds that after a period of time a working drug stops working and symptoms of depression return they may be advised to try an NSRI. This was the case with me. I have been treated for my depression for years and had done extremely well for periods of time on several different drugs at different times. Moving from one to the next as I bottomed out on each. Celexa and Lexapro being the most recent. When Lexapro let me down after a couple of years I was advised to try Pristiq which was just released only a few months before my doctor suggested it. I was extremely hesitant as I did not want to go through another adjustment period of sleeplessness; headaches; possible weight gain; sexual issues; etc. You know the drill if you have taken drugs for deperession. So I chose to stay on my Lexapro and be depressed; hoping that it would start working again at a higher dose. Wrong. Getting to the end of my rope with my depression I finally decided to bite the bullet and try the Prestiq. My depression disappeared within 3 weeks leaving me feeling better than I had in months. I began smiling again and fully functioning doing the things I enjoy and had let slide. My sense of well being and hopefulness for the future returned.,Honestly; none for me. I sleep; did not gain an ounce; in fact I lost a small amount of weight even though I did not need to; no sexual side effect at all! Only thing that was tough was waiting for the dosage level to become theraputic in my system; which as I mentioned took about 3 weeks.,I was instructed to continue on the Lexapro at a lower dose for one week. At the 2nd week add my dose of Pristiq to the lower dose of Lexapro; at the 3rd week drop the Lexapro completely and continue on my dose of Pristiq. This was done while staying in contact with my prescribing doctor. Now I take 1 50mg tablet everyday of Pristiq; and am doing very well.
patient,34,female,depression,anxiety,none,Pristiq (Desvenlafaxine) ,Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,50mg  taken once a day for the period of about 5 months,No side effects; other anti-depresson pills usually made me stop taking them because of the side effects; but Prestiq had none. I actually felt better after taking my pill; I was more bubbly and felt like my old self. I was also less aggravated and could think more clearly.,I did not have any bad side effects. The only bad thing I can say about Prestiq is it is expensive about $50 a month even with insurance. There is no generic as of yet.,I would take one pill before bed time each day. I have noticed as with other anti-depressants I would have to take them at bed-time or they would keep me awake. I didn't notice any problems with prestiq when taken in the morning.

The other side effect that I experienced was loss of emotion; I was neither happy nor sad.  This is what made me stop taking the medication.  I switched to zoloft which worked just made me gain 18 lbs and now in the process in switching to something else.,see above

I'm sure there are very unpleasant withdrawal symptoms if you stop taking it.,hit a couple of years ago and nothing seemed to work well and I developed major anxiety issues.  I started on Estrogen replacement and then asked my Dr what we could try that was closer to the Effexor I tried years ago.  That's when we tried Pristiq.  He seemed amazed at the results.  I do not need a "drug cocktail" anymore....I felt like Elvis for years.  I love my life again!

This medication seemed to take the edge off the anger as well as decrease my depressive symptoms. I started at 10mg; then shortly increased to 20mg; which left me feeling too drugged. It was only after 12+ months of taking 10 mg that it was increased due to increasing depressive symptoms.,Initially the medication made me very drowsy. I began taking it at bedtime; which seemed to eleviate that particular concern.  I think there may have been some weight gain; but I am not certain that it was specifically related to the Lexapro. Also; I did initially have difficult acheiving orgasm; but this side effect seemed to diminish within 6-9 months.,I'm not sure waht you mean here- I started on the medication over 2 years ago at 10 mg a day. The dosage was increased to 20 mg after about 12 months.  The side effects were limited; and mostly not perticularly bothersome.

For years I cried everyday; freaked out at the drop of a hat; yelled all the time; had no self esteem and sometimes thought I could not go on. After two weeks of taking Lexapro I am a completely different person. I have not cried once after the first week of being treated. I love myself and my kids. All the menial tasks that I felt so difficult before; I now do with a great sense of ease. My friends and family notice a huge change in me. I couldn't be happier.

I started taking it during a difficult period and it helped lighten my mood.  I did not feel like I was numbed or that I was unable to feel highs and lows.,I gained a few pounds.  It may have had a slight effect on my sex drive; but that is hard to tell.,I started on 10 mg/day for a few weeks and then went to 20/mg a day.  This seemed to be a more effective dose for me.

I suffered from panic attacks in the past and the Lexapro definitely helped with these.  The Lexapro also assisted with symptoms of depression.,did not have any treatment side effects,My doctor started me on a very low dose to treat some situational depression and panic attacks.  The 10mg did not work well enough and eventually I was given 15 and then 20.  The 20mg seemed to do the trick without any additional side effects.
patient,28,female,Anxiety,None; I am a very healthy individual.,None. ,Lexapro (Escitalopram) ,Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,1,Marginally Effective,Severe Side Effects,5 - 10 mg aday  taken i took this once a day for the period of Approximately six months.,Initially; Lexapro helped alleviate some of the stress I was experiencing. I noticed that situations that would normally aggravate me (i.e. stress of work; children; college assignments;etc.) I was able to handle better. ,Although some stress was alleviated; I noticed that I spent more time in a "vegetative" state. I am normally a very active person who enjoys exercising daily. While on Lexapro; I found myself preferring to just relax and watch televison (did cause slight weight gain due to this). More serious and traumatizing side effects was the sudden onset of severe chest pain; rapid heartbeat; dizzy spells; sweating; fatigue; numbness in legs and nausea. The first episode occurred one day at work causing an ambulance to be dispatched to job. From that day on; these attacks happened quite frequently; my doctor took me off the medicine. However; these attacks continued to occur for over a year later (never happened to me before Lexapro). In fact; these effects started a two year long string of attacks; visits to cardiologists; emergency rooms; my fear of exercising as increased activity seemed to affect my heart and induce rapid heart beat. I began to fear driving as my dizzy spells would occur for no apparent reason; as well as the numbness in my legs. No doctor was much help; in fact I often got treated as if I was crazy and was just told that I am suffering from panic attacks. I understand that panic attacks can occur out of nowhere in ones life and once you have them you may experience continued anxiety. I believe the Lexapro opened this pandoras box for me though. I read somewhere that an earlier version of Lexapro (or similar type of pill) caused heart problems thus was pulled off the shelves. Who knows the story behind that. It has taken me two long horrific years to get back on track. I am now approaching my issues naturally and am doing better (not to say this completely stopped my life - but it did seriously change it).,I took approximately 5mg a day. I visited my doctor on monthly basis; and was in contact with her via phone during first several weeks (my doc was old school... she really cares about her patients). I was placed on this treatment as I was a single mother of two very young children; employed full time; and attending college full time. The stress wasoccasionally overwhelming and my usual source of alleviating stress (exercise) was no longer helping.

My depression was only minimally relieved.  I stopped taking it within 2 months; because I wanted my sex life back; and luckily it did come back.

After 3 days; I felt good.  I didnot want to stay home and not see anybody.,A little sleepiness at first.,I have always been depressed.  This flared up considerable when I was having trouble with endometrious.  I was just sick of myself.  Within a few days of taking Lexapro; I felt beeter and could make reliable decisions about things.  After my hysterectomy; I needed the meds to work with the HRT.  I just needed a little boost because my body was not responding to the hormone therapy like it should.

The newer antidepressants; particularly Prozac and Effexor; were lifesavers for me and I expect to be on a daily antidepressant for life.  Antidepressants such as Prozac and Lexapro; however; greatly depressed my sexual desire and ability to reach climax (adversely affecting my relationship with my husband).  These medications also "pooped out" (stopped working) after a while; and even when they were working; they would not entirely relieve my low mood.  Ever since my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro several years ago; my mood issues have entirely disappeared with absolutely no adverse sexual side effects.

It was like living in a cloud. I also gained a lot of weight which in turn made me feel bad and sad for myself all over again. ,I just took one a day; in the morning. When I would voice my concern about the perks of the drug with my Doctor; he was just adjust the dosage or try me on something else. I wished he would have advised me to do some psychological exercises to accompany the treatment.

Have had great results with lexapro with only minimal side effects such as a small weight gain.,Would not recommend going off lexapro cold turkey as the effects of doing this are pretty horrible such as head spins; highly recommend slowly weaning yourself off it.  Have had a slight weight gain due to slowing me down considerably.,Doctor prescribed lexapro when I had seen him about black moods & depression which is something I have had on and off since I was very young.   Depression was starting to effect my family life so felt I needed to see a doctor; he prescribed me lexapro as it helps with depression & anxiety.  I was prescribed 10mg and take one tablet daily.

I don't think I benefited at all from taking this drug.,This drug was very toxic to my system because it caused severe rage. I really was never relieved from my clinical depression because I kept hoping that the drug benefits would kick in and kept on taking it until one day I realized that I had to stop taking it. After about 2 months; I realized that I was very agitated constantly. I just thought that it would eventually go away but it never did. My nervousness was getting extreme. One day; I was in a grocery store shopping; pushing a grocery cart; and a little boy walked in front of me pushing a toy cart. I was so agitated that I had an INTENSE DESIRE to ram him with my shopping cart. I realized that this behavior was NOT ME and that the Lexapro was causing the severe rage. I also had a constant desire to start running down the street as fast as I could and NOT stop. I also couldn't sleep at night and if I was able to go to sleep finally; I would only stay asleep for a few hours. I sure hope this medication is taken off the market because it could cause some unstable patients to take other's lives from the severe rage.,This medication is manufactured by Forest Pharmaceuticals; Inc.; a subsidiary of Forest Laboratories; Inc. in St. Louis Missouri 63045. I was given the prescription of taking 10 mg. once a day. I cannot even imagine what would have happened to me if I had taken the full dosage recommended of 20 mg. I would have probably hurt someone badly. I have always suffered from clinical depression and have taken many different medications. Right now; Paxil is helping me with my depression a little. I think that I need to have it "upped" because the usual dosage isn't as effective as it once was. Anyway; my psychiatrist prescribed Lexapro for me because he really believed that this new drug would be just perfect for me. I had no idea that it would cause such turmoil in my life. I was in a constant state of nervousness and my panic attacks had started to get much worse. I just thought that my daily routine was the cause for my anxiety but realized when I had the desire to shove my shopping cart into a little boy who walked in front of me in the store; as I stated before in this report; that I had to quit taking Lexapro. Sometimes; I would sit on my sofa at night and want so badly to just scream at the top of my lungs. My therapist just told me to take a pillow; put it over my face; and scream at the top of my lungs. I was afraid that my neighbors would call the police if they heard me. That was no way to live. This medication was so toxic to me that if I had not realized what it was doing to me; I might have even taken my own life. Because of my great faith in God; I didn't kill myself and finally realized that I had to call my doctor immediately the next morning to report what Lexapro was doing to me. I also have a friend who is taking Lexapro and has taken it for sometime. She also shows signs of rage at times. Just a minor infringement on her and she will go into a state of rage (but not as bad as I did). I have tried to tell her that she needs to get off Lexapro but she just thinks that OTHER people are intimidating her. One day; when she rams her car into someone elses because they pulled in front of her; she will finally realize that Lexapro is not the drug for HER either. I really do think that Lexapro should be taken off the market until further testing is done. I would NEVER recommend this drug to anyone. It is just too unstable.

It could have been a side effect of my depression; however; I felt it was from the Lexapro because it was more extreme in the beginning of my takning this medicine and subsided somewhat after the medicine had been in my system for a while.  No matter how much I slept; I never felt rested and could still sleep a full night also.  This could also be attributed to my working night shift; however; once I quit taking the Lexapro; the need to sleep so much during the day subsided. ,I was prescribed 10mg initially and this was not enough so my dose was increased to 15mg.  I would occasionally take an additional 5 mg; totalling 20mg; but this was rare.  I eventually weaned myself off of the medicine.  My doctor said that it would be acceptable for me to do this myself as I felt ready; largely because my father had died and my mother had remarried and we both felt it was going to be a temporary need only.  I took Lexapro for approximately 6-8 months.   
patient,31,female,anxiety,depression,Wellbutrin XL,Lexapro (Escitalopram) ,Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,10 mg  taken once per day for the period of 2 years,The benefits to the treatment were that my anxiety was significantly decreased.  It took almost two months for the benefits to kick in; but when they did it was well worth it.  The depression also decreased significantly.  I'm not sure if that was due to the addition of Wellbutrin; or if the reduction in anxiety was so great as to reduce the depression.,There were several side effects worth noting.  First of all; the Lexapro caused serious lethargy and loss of energy.  Taking the pill at night rather than in the morning helped with this side effect; as did the addition of Wellbutrin.  Weight gain also occurred; as well as a severe decrease in libido.  When weaning off of the Lexapro; severe dizziness occurred.  ,10 mg of Lexapro (daily) was prescribed.  It was taken every day for nearly two years; in conjunction with check-ups with the prescribing psychiatrist every six months.  (The psychiatrist determined that the anxiety was due to a chemical imbalance and not situational.  Therefore; regular visits and/or therapy were not necessary.)  After two years on the medication; treatment ended due to inability to tolerate the side effects noted above.  During the weening process; severe dizziness occurred.  The only way to alleviate the dizziness was to take a Lexapro pill.  As the weening continued; dizziness occurred less often and longer periods of time elapsed before it was necessary to take another pill.  Eventually; the dizziness ceased completely.

I wasn't as on edge. I wasn't as anxious. I haven't had any more anxiety attacks and Lexapro has helped me. ,I did not personally have any side effects from taking Lexapro. I gained 5lbs after starting it; but it was also winter time and I seem to gain 5 pounds around the holidays anyway. No trouble taking it off in the spring so I don't think it was an actual side effect--just too much of the holiday food.,I had never had a panic or anxiety attack before. After having my first one; and being scared to death to have another one; my doctor put me on Lexapro. I take 10mg/ day and have not increased it. 
patient,48,female,depression,insomnia,trazodone,Lexapro (Escitalopram) ,Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,7,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,20 mg  taken 1/day for the period of 3 years,happier; slept better. The Lexapro helped with energy levels and anxiety; the Trazadone with sleep. Together they worked quite well; I thought; as I was peppier during the day and slept well at night. So all in all; I would say that this was an excellent combination for someone suffering from sleep deprivation; which contributed to depression; low energy; and anxiety. I felt cured,groggy sometimes. And I could not really stop; though I was able to play with the amount of the trazodone; lowering it down to 50 mg. whenever ever I could. I did not notice side effects from Lexapro; just perhaps that I became flat overtime--not depressed but no super excited either. So at a certain point; I wanted to get off. I had wonderful dreams on trazodone; but would sometimes go back to sleep in the morning for 1-3 extra hours.,50-150 mg of trazodone and 20 mg of lexapro daily. I took all at night; just before going to bed. I would when trying to bring the Trazodone down--so I would be less groggy in the morning-- go very slowly; 25 mg less every few days. Usually this would work. If I woke in the middle of the night; I would immediately get up and take another 50 mg. I have probably taken up to 250 mg in one night; but very rarely. And I have had long periods where I was at 50 mg; only taking more if I was really stressed out or my mind was buzzling with too many details. I recommend this combination really.

I have noticed that if I am inconsistent with taking the medication regularly I will feel anxious or moody. If I drink alcohol the medication does not seem to counteract the anxiety. ,After the birth of my daughter I suffered from what seemed like acute anxiety attacks. Coupled with my unpredictable mood cycle and my inability to control my emotions my doctor recommended 10mg of Lexapro daily combined with talk therapy.

I feel the old myself again and can function well at work.Sometimes I still experience anxiety attacks but they are not severe. I highly recommend this drug due to minimum of side effects in comparison with other antidepressant drugs.,None; the only disadvantage was it started working after 2 weeks of usage.,The treatment is supposed to last 1-1.5 years

I could handle the small things better than before; which used to set me off.  It evened out my moods so that I was less tempermental.,If I missed taking a dose; I would feel a bit lightheaded; dizzy or have a headache.  Too many missed doses lead to a really irritable mood.,After a break-up; I was very depressed and upset all the time.  I began taking a dose of 20mg and within a few days; noticed a difference.  I had fewer dramatic mood swings; and was able to handle the everyday things that got me upset in a more reasonable manner.  I did not feel like crying as frequently as before the medication; and I feel it helps me keep a pretty even temper.  I continue to take this medication because I have been told I have a natural chemical imbalance; and this keeps me from being overly emotional when it is unnecessary.  Overall; I feel I benefit from taking it; and unless I miss a dose; I have no side effects.

Mood neither improved nor deteriorated; and anxiety was never significantly alleviated.  Unsurprisingly; recent research suggests that SSRIs are only effective in the most severe of cases.,On the plus side; I experienced no major side effects.  The possible effects can range from nausea to sexual dysfunction; but none were a problem.  However; it is possible to feel a sort of withdrawal.,The pills are administered once a day; daily; for as long as you think it's worth taking them.  The prescribing physician recommended taking Lexapro for at least six months to get the full benefit of its normalizing effects.

This was a huge relief because before that I was comparing myself to others 24/7. I was able to handle stressful situations calmly. Nothing could make me upset.,I did not gain or loose weight. My sex drive became non-existent. I was no longer able to achieve orgasm. This really became an issue only when my dose was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg. Ultimately; I stopped the pill because of this. Now; I am starting again (only 10 mg/day) because I am so lethargic; depressed; and full of obsessive thoughts.  ,My dose was increased from 10 mg to 20 mg after about 2 months. I took the 20 mg dose for one month but then I abruptly stopped because of the side effects. I did not have any problem stopping the pill (no withdrawal symptoms at all). My sex drive and the ability to orgasm came back.

I noticed a considerable reduction in my anxiety and feelings of sadness. I was able to overlook the little things where as before they would really get to me. I was having all kinds of muscle twitches so I went to see my doctor who examined me and decided it was due to my stress levels. I am a mother and a wife and I was reluctant to take anything to help with my situation but am now glad I did.. I am only a week into it so I guess time will tell. But so far I am happy with the results. ,Slight headache/stress in neck after the first dose although could be due to my resistant feelings of taking this to begin with. A bit of feeling shaky right after taking doses but controlable. ,I am to meet up with my doctor again after 2 weeks to see how it is affecting me. I am taking 10mg once a day in the afternoon after lunch. I have made an appointment with a therapist to also help me. I don't see this as a forever fix but for now it is doing the trick..... Meanwhile it allows me to focus and feel like I want to better myself so in the end I am hoping that this is just a bandaid until I heal myself or find a way to deal with things as needed.

The depression was less affected; but definately improved.  I felt much calmer and able to deal with my situation more effectively.  I wasn't panic striken anymore or weeping all the time.  ,At first the dose of 20mg left me a little zombie like.  I'd sit and stare out the window all day.  When the dose was reduced to 10mg. this side effect went away.  I also developed a clenched jaw; which sometimes I snapped and my teeth grinding became much worse.  I also developed ringing in my ears.  I also gained weight; a total of 25 pounds.,I was treated for anxiety and depression with this drug; beginning with 20mg and then reducing it to 10mg.  I was going through a divorse at the time and could not cope with the overwhelming crisis.  This drug was given in combination with cognitive psychotherapy and together I believe they were very effective.  I was able to be weaned off very easily after one and a half years and feel fine now.  The side affects were a bit troublesome and they remain; ie.  the teeth grinding and ringing in the ears and weight gain.

I suffered for 20 years with depression and anxiety and minor mood swings.  Since taking the current medications I have a much more stabel mood.  I occasionally have days with more depression.  Before taking the meds; I was almost non functional; not wanting to do anything; feeling helpless and hopeless and at times suicidal.  Now; I rarely ever have even fleeting thoughts of that.,constipation; sleep disturbance.  The constipation has been severe; requiring stimulant laxatives about twice a week.  I also believe that I have had an increase in appetite.  At times I wonder if my memory is as sharp.  Overall; I have had minimal side effects.,continue to take the above medications for chronic depression. I tried an antidepressant first for a long time with a number of changes.  I was also given klonopin for sleep.  I could not take it during day because of sleepiness and lethargy.   Later they added Adderall as I have also fibromyalgia.  This helped the depression and low energy.  I continued to struggle with my condition even though it had improved a little.  Lamictal was added and later abilify.  I have tried to decrease dosage or stop some of these and almost immediately my mood is depressed.

Occasional dry mouth. On 10mg Lexapro failed to relieve depression and associated symptoms. On 20mg Lexapro resulted in an overall flat feeling where patient was unable to feel any strong emotions (happy; sad; angry). ,At 15mg patient is able to feel emotions and manage minimal depressive symptoms while undergoing accompanying psychotherapy treatment.

The medication would probably have been more effective had it been combined with a talking therapy; but it was not.,The treatment had no significant side effects; aside from a little bit of nausea during the initial day or two.  None of the more serious effects listed on the bottle were ever a problem.,Basically; I had anxiety attacks and was prescribed Lexapro.  I took the pill once a day every day for about a year; when I was weaned off.  Apparently; if you don't wean yourself; you can experience withdrawal.

Anxiety disappeared. Since I have been on Lexapro I have realised I have been depressed most of my life. I have a very strong family history of major depression. I was in denial to the fact I was depressed. When you have always been depressed you don't know any different. Since Lexapro I have felt alot calmer and happier. The intense guilt I felt about everything has almost gone. My mind would also constantly relieve traumatic past events and mistakes I had made. I really didn't ever want to wake up in the morning - but now I do. The depressive need to sleep in the day time has gone. I am also becoming much less socially isolated; more confident and have began ejoying life. I would have liked to find Lexapro Many years ago. ,I started taking 5mg daily for the first two weeks and did feel an increase in anxiety which subsided after a couple of days. When I increased to 10 mg the anxiety returned and then again subsided. I also felt "far away and fuzzzy headed" for about 3 weeks. Insomnia was also an initial side effect. After 6 weeks I am not experiencing any side effects and am extremely grateful for my improved mood.,I began taking Lexapro for 6 weeks. I started at 5mg for two weeks and then increased it to 10mg. I plan to continue taking it for a long time as i have never felt better.

Also; I wouldn't always take Lexapro consistently; and when symptoms returned; by resuming Lexapro; I experienced results in 2-3 days.,In the beginning; I felt a little dazed and disoriented for the first 1-2 weeks of taking Lexapro. Once my body adjusted to the drug; I felt like it took the edge off irritability and made me feel like my old self. Sustaining side effects were sexual; a decrease in ability to orgasim.,10 mg of Lexapro was prescribed to be taken 1x daily. I was advised that this drug builds up in the system over time and that results generally wouldn't be measurable until taken consistently for a minimum of 4-6 weeks.

In addtion to Major Depression Disorder; I also have Anxiety Disorder; and prior to treatment; I occassionally get into hyperventilation. I felt better after several days into taking Lexapro; and I was able to sleep better also.,I had nobody to take me to my doctors' offices; so I had to drive myself around. The sedation side effect was very strong on me; and I could not drive safely. My friends also made comments that my responsiveness had gone a lot worse at that time.  By the third week into taking Lexapro; I had to call my doctor and requested to have a different drug in replacement.,To treat the Major Depression Disorder and Anxiety Disorder; I visited my psychologies on a weekly basis; and my psychiatrist once every two or three weeks. The first drug that the psychiatrist recommended was Lexapro; and I started with the 5 mg dosage; after which I took the 10 mg for about three weeks. As mentioned above; I had to call my psychiatrist by the third week to request a different drug due to significant side effects.

After taking the medication; these problems were aliviated. ,reduced overall emotional output - before taking Lexapro; i would have episodes of hyperactive behaivour; and would be very outgoing; loud and extatic. I injoyed these; and felt they were part of my personality. This was dumbed down dramatically by the medication.

Consequently; my sleeping pattern normalized.,the drug for consecutive days quickly (in ~40 hours) triggered a single withdrawal symptom: brain zaps. Each zap lasted about 0.5 seconds; and seemed to be triggered by "mild sensory overloads"; e.g.; entering a room with different lighting conditions. The zaps were not painful at all; just confusing and (initially) frightening. Upon resuming the drug; the zaps disappeared as quickly as they had appeared (~20 h).,Treatment was initiated by a general practictioner for self-reported tiredness and panic attacks. The next appointment was in two weeks. Since there were no continuing side effects; and the drug seemed effective; we decided to continue it for at least 6 months. I have now been taking it for 3 months.

I decided to stop taking them; I weaned myself off over a few weeks. After this time I was a new person; the world felt real again; I was no longer plodding through life in a daze; I was so much happier; the things I used to enjoy I started to enjoy again. I am extremely angry that I cannot get back those years that I was taking various anti-depressants that turned me into a zombie who did not care about anything or anyone. I understand everyone is different and these may work for some people; but for me these drugs ruined my life; if you are taking them you could be missing out on so much; please consider whether they are doing more harm than good!

However; seem to gloss over the importance of studying and doing the reading and consequently; was behind when the exam period came and had to go on Ritalin to get through this period.

This drug really helped me to control my temper.  In fact; the temper became nonexistent.  I used to yell a lot and stopped completely within two weeks of being on this medication.  However; this was the only benefit I experienced.  ,I had no sex drive and was unable to orgasm.,to say; at my doctor's appointment today I asked to be switched and will begin Wellbutrin right away.

patient,32,female,depression,acne,sulfacet-r topical for acne,Lexapro (Escitalopram) ,Psychotherapeutic-Agents Psychotherapeutic-Agents Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors Selective-Serotonin-Reuptake-Inhibitors,7,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,15 or 20 mg / day  taken daily for the period of going on 5 years,Taking Lexapro has become a staple in my life.  I come from an extremely depressed family history including suicide in the family and extreme bi-polar disorder in my father.  Without some kind of anti-depressant I literally cannot sleep at night due to low positive brain chemicals causing me to wake every few hours and have a very hard time falling asleep.  Therefore I take 15 mg prophylactically of Lexapro long-term.  I would rather not be on anything at all but unfortunately have tried that in the past without success.  I do think this drug can be very good if it helps you; though it is not a cure all by any means.  ,The side effects for me included slightly lowered sex drive but not completely gone and climax is still possible.  I am drowsier on this drug than I was before and have lost some of my motivation regarding goals and dreams.  However; it is worth it to also lose the insomnia and crying spells.,I have tried 20 mg per day in divided doses (10 mg a.m. and 10 mg before bed at night) as well as 15 mg per day administered once in the morning.  I prefer the 15 mg although the 20 does work a little better as long as I divide the doses.  I am staying at 15 because I would like to take as small a dose as possible while still managing my depression symptoms.  I was happier overall on 20 mg however.  Oddly enough; taking 20 mg once in the morning rather than divided into a.m. and p.m. seemed to make my depression worse and I found myself crying more.  All in all the best for me is 20 mg with half in the morning and half at night.  However; for long term use I prefer to take 15 mg just once per day at night.

I forced myself to work; and would come home exhausted. I had suicidal ideation and severe anxiety. I had "bouts" of depression before; but was never treated. My separation and death of my Mother and loss of my job in one years time pushed me past what I could get myself out of. I was irritable; unsociable; had no desire to eat (lost 50 lbs that I could stand to lose in 6 months); cried all the time. I started Lexapro 3 months ago; almost 4. I began at 10 mg and it was upped to 20 mg. I feel like I am starting to have my life back. I laugh again (genuinely). I can get up for work; I can socialize. I still have days where I feel like crying and am very scared.. but it passes quickly. I have almost regained my general sense of optimism again. (I was always happy go lucky). I have NO ideation anymore.Lexapro is giving me my life back. It is like someone cleaned a really dirty window. I can see things more clearly now and do not ruminate as much as I did or have guilt feelings that are inappropriate. It saved my life.,I have some difficulty sleeping (waking up in the night). Sometimes I have diarrhea; but not enough so it stops me from taking it. I have not had any weight gain; but do feel bloated sometimes. Once in awhile I get a weird high feeling which passes very quickly. ,I have found  that I have to take it at night because of the sedating effect it seems to have on me; but that is not a problem. I was on 10 mg; and ramped up to 20 mg fairly quickly; which was like a shock to my body.. that 3 or 4 days were like a haze; but I stuck with it and it passed. I am on it for almost 4 months now and I am feeling much more like myself.

When I tried to lower (self medicate) the dosage; my racing and repeating thoughts came back really strong.  I started counting again; repeating sentences in my head; singing song verses over and over in my head; replaying conversations over in my head; etc.  Being back on the 20mg keeps me feeling normal and only in very stressful situations do I start obsessing/repeating.,I didn't experience any side effects.  I purposely did not read what the potential side effects might be; as I tend to "develop" whatever I read about.,The initial treatment involved the medication and weekly therapy sessions.  A year into the treatment; I was able to scale the therapy back to "as needed" appointments; a year later I went off of the Wellbutrin and now feel pretty healthy just on the Lexapro.

I felt less depressed and did not feel prone to panic attacks that I had been having prior to starting this medication. I was very pleased with the reduced anxiety and depression. ,At first I had some mild nausea; which went away and then I didn't have any side effects. This medication did not make me gain weight and it did not lower my sex drive- both which were concerns for me.,The medication worked great; and I would have rated it a 10 except getting OFF the medication was difficult. For six-eight weeks I had what I've come to learn are called brain zaps... a strange sensation that is difficult to describe and not pleasant. Lucky for me I had read about this so it did not scare me... otherwise I would have been very concerned. I pretty much just rode it out for those 6-8 weeks and then it went away and I've been fine. If I had to do it over I would still have chosen to take the lexapro because is was so effective for my anxiey/depression which was off the charts when I started.

After 2-3 weeks of starting; noticed my temperament was much more even and felt better able to cope with daily stress and stay motivated.,Fortunately; none for me. I know this type of drug can cause sexual side effects and weight gain; but I have had no issues here. The only thing I noticed was the very first week I took it I was a bit sleepy/groggy during the day; but this went away once I adjusted.,Started out with a very low dose; 5mg/day for the first month; then moved up to 10 mg/day which is my present dose. The full dose is actually 20mg/day; but I feel I am getting the results I need with 10mg; so there is no need to increase the dosage and risk any adverse side effects.

This drug destroyed my marriage. I was so irrationally angry over really stupid stuff. I was raging at my husband for no reason. And it made our marriage crazy to the point that we separated and divorced. I have been told this drug does cause anger in perfectly normal people and that it is like being on speed or cocaine. I would pull this drug from the market.,Irrational Rage. It has nothing to do with my mental state but the fact that the drug does this to everyone. You have to let it build up in your system because your body is trying to reject a poison. You become addicted. No different than cocaine or speed freaks. It is such a lie.,the other comments on this blog were written by drug reps.

I know others on it (my husband); and they have experienced the same kind of success. ,I have never experienced any side effects.

If I miss my dose a few days in a row; I notice my behavior changes and I get moody and worry-some; but it takes a few days to experience that.,I have taken 10 mg a day; every day; for the last 3 years.  It took a few weeks for the medicine to take effect (about 2) and the chance was gradual; but one day i woke up and noticed that I felt normal.  It has been wonderful for me and I am very thankful I have access to it.

Mild grogginess for a short time subsided within one hour of waking.,I encountered no physical side effects; however I did have trouble with insomnia after I discontinued the treatment.

The sleep that I got from this medication was deep and refreshing.,Extreme drowsiness the next morning/afternoon; dependence; slight headache. ,I have had insomnia for as long as I can remember; as it is a symptom of my illness. I usually go to bed around 7 AM if at all; and I don't mind it usually; except when I have responsibilities the next day and I am unable to fulfill obligations due to exhaustion. The first few times I tried Ambien; my doctor prescribed me Ambien CR which is extended-release.. I was taking the 12.5 milligrams. This medication gave me extremely bad headaches and didn't really affect my sleeping pattern. I went back and asked her to prescribe me another dosage; and she gave me the lower 10 mg dosage; not extended release. This dosage makes me feel very groggy at night; and a little drugged out. I have noticed dependency issues developing with it; even in my short time taking it.

If I did not receive enough sleep it would be very hard to wake up and I would feel as if I had not slept at all making it very hard to stay alert.  I would say at least 6-7 hours of sleep is needed.,Take one daily at bedtime for rest due to anxiety.  This prescription was issued for six months and I am currently still taking it.  It does not appear to be addictive as there are nights when I can sleep without it and do not crave it.  
patient,36,female,sleep deprivation,fatigue,none,Ambien (Zolpidem) ,Sedatives-Hypnotics,4,Moderately Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1 a night  (dosage frequency: daily)  for the period of 1 month,I had been having a pro-longed sleep deprivation problem; and was very fatigued and emotionally drained from it. I tried Tylenol PM but i read the negative effects on the liver from taking Tylenol frequently so I discontinued use. I finally went to the doctor to see what they might suggest; and after a consultation; i was prescribed Ambien. After trying it; I discovered that I would go out to sleep very deeply; and have vivid nightmares. I would wake up 3 to 4 hours later every night though; and only be able to go back to sleep very lightly. After a month of that; I gave it up. I ended up taking 5HTP for awhile with melatonin and now I sleep much better. ,Nightmares; short sleep time,I was to take 1 nightly for 1 month to see if this helped my problem; then return to doctor for consultation.
patient,59,female,inability to fall asleep easily,fibromyalgia,wellbutrin,Ambien (Zolpidem) ,Sedatives-Hypnotics,8,Considerably Effective,Mild Side Effects,5mg  taken 2-3 times week for the period of 1 yr,I have a background of worry and stress-related symptoms where I am unable to wind down at the end of the day. With this drug I am able to fall asleep within 30 minutes,Depending on how late I go to bed; and how early I get up in the morning; sometimes would wake up groggy. I would need at least 7-8 hours of sleep to not get groggy.,1/2 of a 10 mg pill as needed. Purposely would take it sparingly due to any addictive issues. Some doctors believe it is truly addictive; others not so. But I believe in as few drugs as possible in my life. I am also very afraid of any type of addiction. Therefore; I opt to split the pill in half and only take it 2-3 times a week.  
patient,35,female,insomnia,none,none,Ambien (Zolpidem) ,Sedatives-Hypnotics,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,5 mg  taken 1 before bedtime for the period of 1 week and as needed,very quick sleep induction within 30 minutes; frequently even faster.  No grogginess in the morning; felt very refreshed.  I also took the medicine to aid in jet lag and during long flights. ,none for me; however; I  know someone who had hallucinations,1 5 mg tablet 30 min prior to intended bedtime.  Need to have at least 7 hours of uninterrupted sleep in order not to feel groggy
patient,33,female,Insomnia,None,None,Ambien (Zolpidem) ,Sedatives-Hypnotics,3,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,10mg  taken as needed for the period of months,The drug does get the patient to sleep very soon after taking the drug.,The side effects are not worth it.  While it gets you to sleep; it makes you incredibly groggy the next day.  I had problems concentrating.  Also; I started sleepwalking with no memory of my actions.  This can be very dangerous.  Also; after taking it for a few days; it would become difficult to stop taking it.  I would rather not get as much sleep rather than take this medication.  I only take it a few times a year now mostly to reset my clock if I've traveled; but would never take it on a regular basis.,The treatment does not require very much other than taking the prescribed drug as needed.  However; if you take it a few nights in a row; it it difficult to stop.  But you should stop because it makes you very groggy and gives you headaches during the day.  It is good for a sleepness night when back from traveling so that you can get back on a regular sleep schedule.  It should not be taken on a regular basis.

I did not experience the rapid effect that I've often read about; i.e. that I would fall asleep within 20 minutes even if I was in the middle of an activity. It usually took about 40 minutes to take effect.,After a while I seemed to notice that I was mildly 'groggy' for several hours after waking up. I was working at a garden center at the time and was frequently forgetting where I had left something. The joke was that I had my own private 'lost and found'.,Not sure what this means. I was prescribed this drug for insomnia which could have been menopausal related. I took the drug nightly for approximately two years. About half way thru this time I tried to quit but the insomnia returned so I continued. The second time I successfully quite and have not had a problem since that time.

Despite being tired at night when I go to bed; I find that I can't "shut my mind off" and need a little help to actually get the rest I need.  Ambien helps me get a really good night's sleep; but doesn't leave me with a hung-over feeling that other meds do.  I usually only take 1/2 of the 10 mg tablet; and that's enough to help me drop right off.

I'm not sure how effective the time release is; because I often would wake up 4-5 hours later. Sometimes I didn't take it to sleep; but upon waking at 3pm; would take one to go back to sleep. They say to not take unless you have 8 hours to sleep; but this is not the case with me. The cutoff time is 4-5 hours.,I sometimes feel groggy the morning after. The one time I took it nightly for 3 weeks; I had been under a great deal of stress; and then jet lag (I travelled to Europe). In addition to the grogginess; I also just didn't feel good.Very hard to describe; but a bit rundown and not clear-headed. For occasional use; it is better than the alternative; though I'm not sure I believe the time-release is worth the cost. Next time I'll try the generic.,The treatment details? I like to have it on hand; but not to use unless I can't get to sleep any other way. Often; I go to sleep easily enough; but wake in the middle of the night. If it's 2-3am; I will take one; and might be groggy in the morning; but I function better than if I couldn't go back to sleep. If it's after 3:20am; I haven't tried it yet; because I get up early.

Drug works for 4 or 5 hours then I wake up as usual in the middle of the night. ,I take this in an attempt to stay asleep like the drug promises. I rarely have trouble falling asleep. With Ambien CR; I fall asleep very quickly but still wake up most nights after 4 or 5 hours of sleeping. Therefore; the time release formula does not seem to work with me. In addition; this drug is unbelievably expensive. All in all; neither effective no priced within reason. I would not recommend.

It didn't help me sleep.  I was cranky the next day; depressed; and tired.,I took it for 2 days.  The third day I didn't take it.  Which was tonight.  I keep waking up because my subconsious is terrified of something.  I keep hearing things in my sleep.  I am terrified to go back to sleep. My heart is pounding from the horrible things I keep hearing in my sleep.  I never had this until taking this medication. I think I may miss a day of work tomorrow from not being able to sleep.  I wish someone was here with me so I wouldn't be so afraid to go back to sleep but the sounds I keep hearing are so terrifying.,My doctor gave me some samples for insomnia.

In combination with cutting out tv at least one hour before bed; a hot bath; and occassionally meditiation - I had a sound sleep and awoke rested and revived.,I did not have the much talked about "bad taste" in my mouth.  I did have a "hung over" feeling but not often; and the feeling went away within 5 minutes of waking. ,The treatment worked for me:  I enjoyed a good nights sleep and awoke rested and revived.  Any side effects were minimal and infrequent.  I have tried many other medications over the years and this one is the most satisfactory.

I was more forgetful. I decided to discontinue lunesta because of the amnesia like side effects that interferes with my driving job. Good quality sleep should not make me feel like this. I use 25mg trazodone instead because it's safer for next day driving., My care provider said to use lunesta three times week at bedtime. I only used it once because of the side effect described above. Also I was only able to get 6 hours of sleep instead of the eight that lunesta promoted in their advertisement.

It doesn't always help with jet lag; for instance; and there are other times when I lose half the night anyway; usually in connection with PMDD. It works about 80% of the time. ,The only problem I have with the medication is that it is expensive--about $5.oo per pil--and that it doesn't always work.

The sleep was more refreshing and I woke up without the typical sleeping pill "hang-over".  Even while falling asleep you I didn't feel like I was all of a sudden blind-sided by a brick wall and forced to sleep.  This feels much more natural and real than other medications I have tried.,At first; very vivid and biazarre nightmares and dreams.  These gradually became less severe and less violent or frightening and now I dream normally (for me) and have no other side effects that I have become aware of yet. ,The Lunesta was prescribed to me by my nephrologist as a part of treatment for continued insomnia.  This has been a long term problem and in the past I have tried Remeron (which should be banned...horrible side effects and hangovers); Ambien; which is also very good and Ambien CR...that was wonderful.  Currently I am happy with this treatment.

Normally; I never get a complete night's rest.  After my doctor prescribed Lunesta; it was the first time in a very long time; that I was able to sleep from the time I laid my head on the pillow until my alarm sounded in the morning.,I had no side effects from using Lunesta.  I felt refreshed in the morning without that groggy feeling or "hang over" like feeling.,The treatment involved taking one pill in the evening right before bed.  Lunesta works relatively fast; so you do not want to take it unless you are going right to bed because you become drowsy within 10 minutes.
patient,28,female,Sleeping problems,depression,Prozac; Welbutrin,Lunesta (Eszopiclone) ,Sedatives-Hypnotics Sedatives-Hypnotics,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,3 mg  taken as needed for the period of 5 months,Was able to fall asleep within 30 minutes of taking Lunesta.

Drinking a whole bottle of water with that metallic-taste made me vomit and that taste is still there when you wake up in the morning but goes away after you've been awake for 10-15 minutes. Occasionally; I will have hangover-like symptoms like feeling nauseated; depressed; and constant headaches all day long. If you miss one night; you will not be able to get any sleep at all. I've gone 72 hours without sleep once because I ran out and the pharmacy took forever to refill it. In the mornings when you wake up; you will need at least 4 cups of coffee to get out of bed. I've tried everything from reducing the dosage to sleeping earlier than normally and nothing helps to prevent that problem. All in all; not any fun.,I'm still taking Lunesta but that's only because I am supposed to see my doctor this week to discuss modifications and adjustments.

Sleep-walking.  Two of the many examples:  Got up and took a bath with NO recollection.  Another time got up and BAKED COOKIES...made the dough; baked the cookies; cleaned up the kitchen; put the cookies in the jar....with not ONE recollection I did it.  ,Was told I fall into the low percentage of people who have these same side-effects.  Taken off Lunesta and cannot take Ambian for the same reasons.  Tried Melatonin; 5mg a night...works like a charm and I haven't been in the kitchen baking!

I haven't had the pleasure of yawning. ,I read carefully over the booklet and the website; thinking that maybe i was doing something wrong. I took the lunesta along the zanaflex hoping for a better result and; none!! Took it at 11pm and 3:44am; im still going strong-not even a yawn! I was formally on ambian; which would take over an hour to kick in; but my sleep time was averaging about two hours.
patient,41,female,insomnia,anxiety,none,Lunesta (Eszopiclone) ,Sedatives-Hypnotics Sedatives-Hypnotics,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,3 mg  taken every night for the period of 1 year,Lunesta definitely put me to sleep and kept me asleep until morning.,There was a hangover from the medication well into the morning hours after waking.,For years I had suffered with insomnia until my doctor prescribed Lunesta in a 3mg dose.  It worked very well putting me to sleep and I did not wake until morning.  Unfortunately I could sleep 10 - 12 hours and still wake up with a hangover from the medicine.  Sometimes a half of a pill would do but I would still have somewhat of a hangover although not as bad.  Now I only take during times of stress when sleeping is more important than any of the side effects.
patient,33,female,Insomina,Alpha 1 Antitrpsin Disorder,Prolastin,Lunesta (Eszopiclone) ,Sedatives-Hypnotics Sedatives-Hypnotics,1,Ineffective,Severe Side Effects,3mg  taken 1 daily for the period of 1 day,NONE,HORRIABLE taste in mouth with 15 minutes of taking it. Even breathing tasted bad as when the air hit my mouth and airway the taste was intensified. I tried to drink water to get rid of the taste and promptly threw up the taste was so bad. Within half an hour of taking the pill I developed a red rash on my face; and in an hour had a full blown lights and floaties migraine. To top it all of my insomonia was actually MADE worse. Two hours after taking the pill I am more awake and alert then I was BEFORE taking it.,This is by far the worst medication I have ever taken. I got no help; in fact the problem got much worse and the side effects were unbearable!

It works well without making me sleepy the next day like Ambien did.  It also works quickly as long as you lie down right away.,Bad taste in mouth in the morning was bothersome in the beginning but it goes away over time the longer you take the drug.  However; lineage did not work well at all if I ate anything near bed.  The directions say it does not work well with fatty foods.  But; it also did not work if I even took a fish oil supplement; which is a fatty acid.  Even the smallest amount of fat; like a pat of butter on a piece of toast renders it ineffective.  When that happens; I would cut another pill in half and would be able to sleep.  This is a time release drug and should not actually be cut in half!,Taken as needed for insomnia.

Then increase the pill to the regular dose gradually after that week.  The medication is suppose to stop you from wanting to smoke basically by making you sick to your stomache when you smoke. During the first week you can smoke; but the second week you have to stop.

patient,56,female,smoking cessation,none,hormone replacements,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,7,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1 tablet  taken 2 x day for the period of 2 months,This drug blocked the receptors for nicotine; so the cravings were extremely diminished. The dosage was increased over a week; so the physical withdrawal symptoms were decreased slowly.  ,The worst side effect was nausea.  When I reached the twice daily dose; I was nauseated most of the day. It was much better when I cut the pills in half and took them several times a day with plenty of liquid and food.  The other side effect is constipation. A low dose of a laxitive is helpful with this.,physical withdrawal was easier than times in the past.  I was somewhat irritable for a few days; but nothing severe.  The nausea and constipation were annoying; but I was able to work around them. The mental obsession of this addiction is still present at times; but no pill is going to make that go away. It has gotten easier with time. 
patient,41,female,Qit smoking,none,bupropion,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,1mg  taken twice a day for the period of 2 months,enabled me to quit smoking; I think it works well; and even better combined with zyban/bupropion,no side effects,Choose a future date to quit smoking. (I picked a date 3 months in advance)Start taking the pills a couple weeks before the quit date.  I actually started smoking less without trying.  Chantix interfers with the pleasure receptors in your brain; so smoking is not very satisfying.  I have now been smoke free for 1 month.

Was able to reduce smoking to half pack per day in the run up to totally quitting.  Then was able to quit.,Skin itching; insomnia; strong urine smell; weight gain,The side effects; aside from the weight gain; were tolerable enough to enable me to quit.  I have back slid a couple of times and found taking the pill for a few days resolved the problem.  It has been a year since I first started taking the drug.

That is what I did; and I set my date at ten days after I starting taking the medication. In less time than ten days; I was not reaching for a cigarette with my morning coffee. I stopped smoking all together in two weeks; but took the medication for four months. When family and friends that are smokers would come over; I would want to smoke with them. I restarted the program twice; then told myself I would just have to NOT smoke with them.

As I have read; its not so much the nicotine; since I can sleep for 8 hours without craving nicotine; its the little voice in my head that tells me its time for my bad habit.  It also surpressed any craving for alcohol.,Vivid dreams; and the loss of my intuitiveness.,One pill twice daily with alot of water.
patient,44,female,Smoking cessation,N/a,N/a,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,10,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1mg   taken 2 times per day for the period of 3 months,I was able to quit smoking after 7 days without major withdrawals.,I experienced vivid dreams.,I tried on numerous occasions to stop smoking but was unable to remain smoke free.  I read about Chantix in a magazine and set an appointment with my doctor to see about getting a perscription.  I began my therapy; set a quit date for one week later.  I followed the instructions and noticed at approximately day three; that my cravings had eased somewhat.  In the days that followed; the payoff I usually recieved from the nicotine no longer had the same effect.  This was somewhat annoying to me; however I continued with the medication until I finally quit smoking.  I have been smoke free for over 6 months off the medication.  Chantix is one of the most effective medications I have ever used.  It really worked for me.
patient,50,female,smoking cessation,none,none,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,1,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,1 mg   taken twice daily for the period of 1 month,The treatment benefits were smoking cessation; first a gradual reduction 2-10 a day then 1-2 a day  then I quit for 2 weeks,I experienced depression and severe anxiety.

Before you realize it... you will have gone a whole day or maybe days/weeks without even thinking about a cigarette subconcsiously and when you do smoke a cigarette there is little to no euphoria or any other sensation for that matter; its just the taste of smoke and nicotine.  I also found it suppressed my appetite and my desire to drink; as well.

Unlike the patched they dont fall off and unlike the nasal spray it makes you stop craving nicotine.,Not able to sleep very well at night. Dont know if this is due to the champix or due to stopping smoking. Also tablets can make you feel slightly sick when you first start taking them but nothing too bad.,take 1mg in the morning 1mg in the evening every day.  The treatment should last for 12 weeks but can be extended for a further 12 weeks if like me you are a heavy smoker.

If you are in a high stress environment then leave this drug alone! If you cannot handle nausea; constipation; insomnia; or fatigue for extended periods of time then DO NOT take this drug.  The nausea will fade but it can get pretty intense and that seems to be the deal breaker for a lot of people -- I can hack a lot before I "cry Uncle"; but let me tell you the nausea will come in waves and will wear you down. BUT in the end it was worth it!!!

Gas was bad at first along with consptipation.  Gas and constipation disappeared when I lowered the dosage from 2 mg per day to 1 mg per day.  Neck/shoulder tension/pain still exists; but worth it to stay smoke free.,Began Chantix Starter pack; then quit on Day 7 or 8 of Chantix.  Been smoke free for 30 days with no withdrawal pains whatsoever.  I plan on staying on 1. mg of Chantix for another 60 days then tapering Chantix until drug free.  This is a miracle drug.  I could not have quit without Chantix.

Was able to make it through the first week of no smoking with VERY CONTROLABLE urges.,Disrupted sleep is the only side effect so far.  However; I'm military and deployed; so sleeping well in these conditions is a luxury anyway.  Vivid dreams...I'm remembering my dreams; which is not normal for me.  Occasional nightmare; and frequent waking.,2 pills a day as prescribed.  I recommend it; but results obviously vary.  A few friends have also used it with identical results.  None of us take *any* other medication; which may be a substantial variable.  So far no suicidal thoughts or rages.

I reset my quit day for 1 week beyond my original date and by my second quit date; I was no longer craving a cigarette. I was able to quit smoking after only 2 weeks on the medication. I no longer craved one when I woke up; after I ate or when I got in my car. It was amazing and I like to call this my little miracle drug. =) 
-,-,-,tobacco addiction,none,none,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,1,Highly Effective,Extremely Severe Side Effects,1 mg qd  taken daily for the period of 2 months,It mostly eliminated the urge to smoke; allowing me to quit. Having tried other drugs to quit smoking; I was shocked by how effective this drug was.,Severe depression; suicidal; that continued for eight months until I decided to start smoking again. Drug made my kidneys ache. My daughter had similar depression/suicidal side effects. In my opinion a dangerous drug.,I followed the recommended drug regime; until I reached a dose of 1 mg a day. I did not feel the need to increase dosage beyond that; as I stopped smoking; and was having side effects of nausea; stomach cramps; kidney pain; as well as mood changes; which I had anticipated; and thought were normal.

While users are advised that initiative must be taken on their part to successfully quit smoking; I felt that the drug decreased the desire for nicotine so effectively; making smoking absolutely repellent; that a patient taking the drug would most likely quit without much active effort.,Vivid dreams; often lasting throughout the night; not necessarily disturbing; as some have reported; but (seemingly) long; deep; and realistic. Perhaps for this reason; I did not awake feeling well-rested while taking the drug. Significant loss of appetite occurred; but sugary foods seemed more appealing. Mood became depressed to the point that suicidal thoughts occurred.,Began taking a low-dose as part of the "starter pack." Desire to smoke diminished quickly and was gone within only a few days. Dose gradually increased to 2 1.0mg tablets/day. Continued with this dosage for close to two months at which time I stopped taking the drug due to the side effects listed above. Have since started smoking again.

I don't really have much else to say.,Nervousness;  cause weird night time dreams and made cigs taste like crap.It made the nicotine completely ineffective.  the desire went down after several days. I don't really have much else to say.,started with smaller doses and titrated up over time.   It made the nicotine completely ineffective.  the desire went down after several days. I don't really have much else to say.

I have a 40 year old habit!,I had constant muscle aches; flue like symptoms; sadness that I could not understand; strong stomach pains;and constant fatigue.  Even combining aspirin and lots of food with my dosage; it did not help. A pleasant side effect were dreams in bold color. Not scary at all.,Take one  1 mg tablet two times per day.  The first several days the dosage was one half until I worked my way up.
patient,25,male,smoking,Smoking,marijuana,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,1mg   taken twice daily for the period of 10 days,WOW. I find this drug to be a powerful cocaine antagonist and nicotine antagonist. ,mild constipation but relieved with fiber rich diet and liquids; strange taste and some deja vu/strange mental sensations. Cocaine Antagonist (positive),I took this drug with the intentions of quitting smoking. I also however; discovered on accident that this drug just about completely blocked the euphoric effects of cocaine and then subsequently blocked the "crash". All that would be experienced was a racy heart and undesirable "too much caffeine" feeling with nausea. This drug has a SERIOUSLY powerful effect on the euphoric of stimulants and needs to immediately be put into treatment plans for stimulant abuse. For Its indications; nicotine; It definately does its job here too my cravings for nicotine are pretty much extinguished though there still seems to be slight reward in an occasional cigarette; just goes to show how much I feel this drug stabilized my ADHD downsides such as deficient dopamine function in my brain. It worked better than bupropion. I understand Chantix has some issues with side effects but hopefully they will work those kinks out because this really looks to be a miracle drug. 
patient,36,female,SMOKING CEASATION,None,None,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,8,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1mg 2x's day  taken 2 times day for the period of 5 weeks taking it,initially made it easier physically to stop smoking however still craving but know that smoking will not give me the same feeling or be as enjoyable due to the blocking of the nicotine receptors being blocked by the drug; so have not smoked.,Full dose made me extremely nasious so am only taking 1 mg at night.  Also; constipation.,Take 1 tablet in AM and one tablet in PM with food and 8 oz of water
patient,37,male,Nicotine Addiction,None,None,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,7,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1mg   taken twice daily for the period of 3 months,I had smoked for 20 years and despite repeated quit attempts using Zyban (bupropion); nicotine patches (and nicotine gum; lozenges etc); I had never managed to stay quit for long. Chantix enabled me to quit my 10 cigar a day habit with minimal craving and after the first week of treatment I really didn't feel the urge to smoke anymore.,things considered; the side effects were worth it for the benefits. As smoking causes premature death a few side effects are a reasonable trade off in order to quit.,Standard treatment regime. 0.5mg on day 1; then 0.5mg BD up till day 8; then 1mg BD till 3 months. Gave up smoking on day 10 though smoking had lost most of its appeal by day 7.

I seemingly derived no benefit from the use of this medication.,nausea; vommiting; depression; vivid dreams; and nightmares.  The vommiting came on within minutes of ingestion and my physician offered no other dosage or medication to alleviate the side effects.,I was to be on this course of treatment for a possible 12 weeks....From the onset of treatment; I experienced every one of the adverse effects and was told that after a few weeks they would subside...So was not the case in my situation...I finally gave up as my life was severely impacted by using this medication.
patient,47,female,Smoking cessation,none,none,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,9,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,2mg/day  taken 2x day for the period of 4 months,Loss of the desire to smoke and eventually the cessation of smoking altogether.,Fatigue and gas.,Literature says that desire to smoke should cease after 2 weeks.  It took about 3 1/2 for me.  Chantix effectively helped me quit smoking without horrible withdrawals and side effects.  It has been 1 year and 4 months now.  I am completely free of cigarettes now.  Chantix was the only thing that helped.
patient,52,female,Stop Smoking Aid,None,Ibuprofen; prilosec,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,5,Considerably Effective,Moderate Side Effects,1 mg  taken once/day for the period of 1 year,Chantix did effectively reduce the urge to have a cigarette.  Taken twice per day was most effective; but side effects precluded that dosage for this patient(see below). Chantix was taken in the morning; and patient rarely; if ever; even thought of wanting or 'needing' a cigarette during the day.  In the evening; however; (when the second pill was due to be taken; but wasn't); and especially if patient had an alcoholic beverage; the urge to smoke returned  with a vengence; though a few puffs were all it took to kill the urge.  When patient stopped taking Chantix (after a year of use); the urge for nicotine returned.,The side effects for patient were 1) an upset stomach directly after taking pill; and 2) VERY disturbing and vivid dreams.  Patient found that; regarding the stomach upset; it was less important to have food in your stomach before taking the pill (stomach still got upset); than to actually take the pill in the midst of eating; (i.e. eat some food; take the pill; then eat some more).  This method of taking the pill virtually eliminated the stomach upset problem.  As to the vivid dreams; that is why the patient only took one pill in the morning and did not take the pill in the evening.  Although patient still occasionally had vivid dreams; the incidence was far less often than when taking the pill twice per day.,Chantix was prescribed per the guidelines noted by the manufacturer.  As noted above; the dosage was altered by the patient to alleviate negative side effects.  Although a stop-smoking plan was packaged with the initial prescription; the patient stopped participating in the follow up due to the lack of urges for cigarettes.  This; however; may be why the patient was on the prescription for a year versus a few months.
patient,53,female,smoking cessation,menopause,premarin; prometrium,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,3,Considerably Effective,Severe Side Effects,2 tablets per day  taken twice per day for the period of two months,It did curb my desire to smoke.  I went from smoking a pack a day after years of smoking to smoking one cigarette a day without using any nicotine substitutes.  However; I never got to the point where I didn't have the one cigarette a day and the side effects were so severe that I had to stop taking the drug.,The worst were the terrible nausea; gas and abdominal distress.  I would be so nauseous after taking the drug that I would have to lie down for about forty five minutes before I could function.  Also; as the treatment wore on; the gas pains became so painful that I just had to stop taking the drug.  The gas pains grew more severe over time.,I took the drug as prescribed but as noted above was not successful at quitting smoking.

Smoked first week and two days of second week.  Find I don't think about having a smoke when first get up or right after eating all the time.  But I still do have cravings at times.  The cravings are manageable.,Only side effect was in the first couple of days; I would feel light headed at times.  I have dreams I remember now verses not remembering them before the drug.  Any other side effect could be contributed to the other medicines I have to take so I can't say if the mood swings or sleeping habits are due to the Chantix.  Major side effect is the cost.  This drug costs two and half times as much as my smoking habit per month.,I did the starter packet for the first seven days as prescriped.  Now I am on the 1mg twice a day.

I spent both of those days unable to move because of the nausea; so my doctor recommended I drop down to .5 mg a day. On that small dosage I became very depressed and began having suicidal thoughts as well as very vivid dreams.  I went off the drug and then tried it again a few months later only to have the same depression issues. I'd rather keep smoking and try to find a new way to quit than to lose my life on this drug.
patient,50,female,Smoking,NA,pain medication,Chantix (Varenicline) ,Smoking-Cessation Smoking-Cessation,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,1mg  taken 2 x daily for the period of 33 days,I feel that Chantix is the best way to quit smoking. It was prescribed my my doctor. I smoked for 30 years. The only time I quit during that 30 years was when I was pregnant. I always started back up within a year. This time I know I won't start smoking again.,I had no treatment side effects at all. The evening pill did make me drousy but that is mentioned on the prescription. It a good thing because people sometimes does not sleep well when they are trying to quit or do quit smoking.,It was the best treatment I could have chose. I am very satisfies with the treatment. It has worked for me. It started having an effect on me the 2nd day of treatment. I noticed the cigarettes tasted bad so I keep putting them out. And I quit before the first week of being on the Chantix.

The urge to smoke lessened significantly from first day.  Went from smoking 15-20 cigarettes a day to about 5-10 the first day.  By the end of the first week a was smoking 1 or 2 a day.  Quit before the 10 days were up.  1.5 years later; I am still not smoking.,Very irritable and angry.  Fell into a depression.,still get occasional cravings but the thought of going through that again keeps me away.  I consider it to be effective but would recommend joining a support group or going to a counselor to help cope with the mood swings.  If you don't have someone you see on a daily basis that can point out those changes I would highly recommend the latter.  I didn't realize that i had fallen into a depression until months into it.

After the pill in the morining I would get extremely nauseous and sleepy. ,I couldn't even keep my head up at work because I was so drowsy. I would have to go lay down in the break room. It got so bad I had to quit taking it. But I decided since it had been 2 weeks smoke free I wouldn't start again just because I couldn't handle the pills. My husband and I have been smoke free for 1 year 2 months!

The first time I took it my skin cleared up in 3 days.  Not only did my acne disappear but my excessively oily skin turned normal in 3 days as well.  Things were great for the time that I was on the medication but about 1 month after finishing it my skin returned to its old self - moderate/severe acne and extremely oily.  I took the second course of this medicine about 1 year later.  The second time was the same dose and time - 30mg per day for 3 months.  It had absolutely no effect on my acne or oily skin the second time around.  I am still battling this problem 10 years later.

It helped in newly developing acne and cleared up the acne I already had.,While it helped my face; it consequently dried out the skin on my whole body as well. This was the third time I had treatment with accutane.  I still have some under-the-skin bumps but they are not as severe as they originally were.,This was an oral treatment and the regimine was twice daily.  I had to constantly use a moisturizer and my lips became the most dried and cracked than they had ever been before.

Temporarily:  eliminated blackheads; smoothed skin texture; skin appeared "poreless".,Dry skin and lips; increased susceptibility to developing blisters on feet if walking long distances without careful attention to socks and shoes.  Stupidly used "Biore" skin strips early in the treatment to speed up removal of the blackheads and pulled all the skin off my nose.  ,I am 43 now but took Accutane back in my early 20's for moderate cyctic acne.  I took a second course in my 30's for mild/moderate non-cystic acne which was probably hormone related.  I absolutely loved taking Accutane and wished that I could take it again at a milder dosage to treat blackheads and have that smooth "poreless" skin again.  It seems to speed up skin cell sloughing and I didn't need to exfoliate; just use a good cream.  After years of taking antibiotics and using awful creams that made my skin dry and red; Accutane was a godsend.  My older brother and sister have terrible deep scars from cystic acne (my sister had dermabrasion many years ago before the age of laser) but I do not have one scar from my cyctic acne.

Aquafor did help alleviate that situation. My mood was mildly affected. I did experience some mood swings from time to time. The other downside was having to go do the monthly bloodwork. Not having insurance and a tight schedule at work made it a little inconvenient and certainly expensive.,Overall it was helpful but there is alot involved in being on the drug and the side effects are tolerable overall. I wish the benefits had a longer residual effect or there were some other long term treatments for cystic acne that were effective

My skin looked flawless. My pores have remained smaller long-term (5+ years post treatment).,My skin got very dry; including my lips. I had to use a significantly heaver moisturizer and lip ointment to keep my skin/lips from cracking.,would encourage patients and doctors not to be so frightened of this drug. It's a serious drug and bears monitoring; but lots of drugs are. I tried Retin-A and that made my skin look and feel horrible; as did other topical treatments. The benefits to your skin and your self-esteem make Accutane worth consideration if other treatments have not been effective.

It has been 10 years and my acne never returned.  ,dry mouth; solved by drinking more water,know there has been a great deal of controversy about this drug and its side effects.

Drug treatment was carried out with bi-monthly visits to physician.  After 25 weeks ended treatment successfully finished treatment.  No recurrence of acne.

I did use lotion in large amounts to combat this so it wasn't too much of a problem. I also had to stay out of the sun to avoid serious burning during the use of the drug.,I took one pill per day for 6 months; at the end of which I noticed a marked decrease in my acne.

It essentially dried up the acne.  It worked amazingly well and the effects lasted for probably a couple of years after a one time 6 month treatment.  I wouldn't take it again however; b/c I wanted I to have babies and did have trouble conceiving years later but; it is unknown to me if this was a result of the acutane.  I do have one biological son and one adopted son.,2 capsules daily and lots of chapstick.
patient,21,male,Acne,None,None,Accutane (Isotretinoin) ,topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,10,Highly Effective,Mild Side Effects,40 mg  taken 2x/day for the period of 5 months,Completely cleared up mild to moderate acne on face; neck; shoulders; back; and arms and should continue to stay clear for some length of time.,Dry; chapped lips and dry; flaky skin especially after showers. Both were completely treatable with chapstick and good lotion. No serious side effects; and no alarming changes in liver function or triglycerides on blood tests. No depression as well.,I had slight to moderate acne that was just really annoying and was not fixed by any type of treatment; so I finally gave in and went on Accutane. After reading all the online horror stories I was scared out of my mind. However; I had a great experience on it. I took 80mg/day for 5 months and weigh 200 lbs (90 kgs) so it was about 1 mg/day/kg; which is a moderate to high dose I was told. My lips were pretty dry and cracked if I didn't put on chapstick all the time. I also had really dry skin if I didn't put lotion on my shoulders; arms; back; and face after showering. Everything else was 100% fine though. No nosebleeds; no depression; no hair loss; no unbearable side effects. These horror stories are overblown and rare; and tons of people have great results on it. My acne is gone 100% from all over my body and it is such a relief to not have to deal with it. On completion; my dermatologist told me he has prescribed it for 10 years and has never once had a case of depression and only 2 people have had bad blood tests. If you're tired of acne; give Accutane a shot. If the sides are too rough in your case then you can go off of it; but it's such a great drug if it works for you the way it did for me and many others like me.

I took this drug with meals and could not be happier. Accutane changed the whole composition of my skin; changing me from very oily to normal/dehydrated in just over two weeks. The remainder of the dosage resulted in secureing my clarity and allowing my skin to look and feel better.,Mild to moderate dryness on the lips and face. Mainly on either side of the face. I noticed very dry lips but peppermint beeswax lip balm seemed to fix the problem. Dryness seemed to be non existent with no blemishes but as soon as a cyst became visible it annhilated the surrounding area in dryness.,After trying topical treatments; subscription products and tetracycline for many months; and with no decernable difference; my family doctor put me on a cycle of Accutane. I was thrilled with the results; and could see the medication working almost instantly. The side-effects dimished after about 3 weeks. I used; and continue to use; 5% benzoyl peroxide gel cleanser and spot treatment (both Panoxyl brand) while on the medication.

I didn't experience anything too drastic; but everyone's different.,Dry skin and lips.  Just keep lotion and chapstick handy; and you'll be fine.,the doctors started me off on high dosage and gradually reduced it.  usually; it's two or three pills a day with meals.  also; one drawback is the monthly blood tests and dermatologists visits.  they are time-consuming; but worth it.

Prior to accutane I HAD to wash my hair daily it was so oily  but now I easily an go a day or two.   My face and back were perfectly clear.,I would have spent my last $2 on lip balm; even if I hadn't eaten in a week!  Talk about dry and flaking!   Don't even THINK about waxing.  I didn't know that you couldn't wax (it was 12 years ago and there was less information about it then) it ripped my skin right off!  Scary.  About 4 ear after my first round I did another go with accutane because my acne had returned and now; 12 years later my skin is one again pretty bad.  Unfortunately not bad enough for accutane.  I mus say however; I have never been as bad as I was before my initial treatment and my back has stayed perfectly clear since then.,You have to really want it to get it!

Now; six years later; I am also having breakouts in my back and in new places like my neck; chest; behind my ears and (believe it or not!) some in my belly.

Really dry eyes and lips; had a problem wearing contacts. ,I would go to dermatologist; he would look over face; would do some sort of vaccum facial to clear pores. He would ask how i was doing. I would cycle on and off the pills. Once done with pills I would come in a few times and have the vaccum facial that he had at the office. I loved that part!

Overall; the action of the drug was quite quick and effective; and my acne was resolved within the first 2 months of treatment,I experienced dry skin like many other users of this drug; as well as some joint pain.

This was my first and last treatment. ,severe sexual side effects began about 2 months into the trial including pain during intercourse; soreness lasting as long as 24 hours followed by periods as long as 2 weeks or more where intercourse was impossible due to intense pain upon penetration; vaginal dryness; and the inability to have a vaginal orgasm.  I also had overall skin dryness; but using a daily moisturizer and medicated chapstick made this very manageable. ,treatment began with two 40mg tablets twice a day; but was reduced to once a day after the first month due to extremely dry skin.  When sexual side effects began in month 2; my dermatologist suggested using a personal lubricant during sex (which was never needed before treatment began) and that the problem would clear up once I was finished with the treatment. I began the treatment in Febuary 2007 and finished September 2007.  The problem with dry skin cleared up rapidly; but I continue to struggle with the sexual side effects (as of June 2008).  I have been treating the vaginal dryness with an over the counter product called Replens since January 2008 and this has helped considerably; but it causes constant vaginal discharge. I am now able to have sex about once ever 2-4 weeks; but have yet to experience a vaginal orgasm.   
patient,15,female,Moderately Severe Acne,N/A,N/A,Accutane (Isotretinoin) ,topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,10,Highly Effective,Severe Side Effects,40mg  taken twice daily for the period of 6 months,Oily skin & hair reduced; clear skin; long lasting results!,Very dry skin; sensitivity to sun; red/dry eyes; severe dry lips; frequent nose bleeds and rashes; minor depression; back pains; and easily worn out.,I am only 15 and wanted to not have to fight acne for the rest of my teen years. I have tried multiple amounts of acne medications; but were all ineffective and I suffered more than I did on accutane. Yes; the side effects were odious; but it was nothing that I couldn't handle. The worst was probably the dry lips; in which I soon discovered that the classic Cherry Chapstick was sent from heaven (and must be applied consistantly). I got a lot of bad sunburns & rashes; and my face was constantly red and peeling. I had to get a quality moisturizer and apply throughout the day; and even that wasn't efficient. I eventually had back pains and wore out easily; red eyes; nosebleeds; and minor depression. In addition; IPLEDGE and the monthly blood tests are a hassle. But from the first week I started to clear up continually without initial breakout until now I am 100% acne free. I used to have very oily skin and hair; which now I don't have to worry about. I know results differ from each individual; but I wanted to spread the word that it can work; and I have a lot of friends that have benefited from this product also. Acne is not the end!

Had recieved antibiotics etc previosly which reduced it from severe to moderate; but then accutane completely cleared my skin after 5 months,Hair loss! Not so much from my head; but other places such as arms etc. Dry lips were the worst; tried many different products but eventually carmex solved that. Dry skin slightly; not too much of a probelem. Depression was bad; would have no motivation to do anything and hated everything around me. After stopping the drug this discontinued and i deem it acceptable to have; for the results of clear skin.,I can't remember ever having the initial flare ups/breakouts other people have reported. I was warned about this by my dermatologist but i can't say i remember it. I noticed no difference in the first few months and became very frustrated at this. It was only towards the end of the fourth month that it started to become noticablly clearer with only a few spots. By the end of the fifth month i was clear; and remained clear for a year. However the oilyness of my skin has returned and i would now class my skin as having mild acne; but it only affects the areas around my nose; unlike before where i had it all over my cheeks. If you notice any spots return; contact your derm to be put on a second course of accutane as i am; otherwise it can return more serverly and undo all the progress you have previously made.

patient,26,female,acne,excess sebum. Very oily hair/skin,none,Accutane (Isotretinoin) ,topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,9,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,40mg/day  taken 1 a day for the period of 5-6 months,Although it's a very powerful/dangerous drug if used while pregnant; or not monitored by your doctor; Accutane really helped my skin. I have tried EVERYTHING! THe benefits were it got rid of all my acne; it shrunk my pores; made my skin less oily; and my hair; smoother skin; brighter skin; even toned. On Accutane i didn't have to wash my hair for 3-4 days. Normally I had to wash my hair everyday because it was so greasy. I would never go without a day of washing when I wasn't on Accutane.,Some of my side effects were really dry lips; sensitive eyes;burning sensation on my face; sensitive skin (if I scratched my hand for example it woulds be sensitive and would scar easily. This time around i had less side effects. The first time on Accutane (10 years ago when I was 16 yrs old) I had bad side effects. I was taking too high of a dose in my opinion 80mg/day. I weighed 100-110 lbs. I had scabbed skin; dry eyes; stomach pain; slight depression; achy body; back pain; joint pain...,FIrst treatment at 16 years old. 2 pills a day of 40mg. With food.  At 26 years old and 105 lbs I took only 1 pill a day that was 40mg. Every month you need to do blood tests to make sure everything is ok. You must be on birth control because being pregnant and on Accutane causes birth defects. Taking Accutane was the only thing that helped me. Although my acne did come back years later from the first time taking Accutane; it significantly changed my skin for the better. The first month of treaatment; your acne usually comes all out; but after that; you're skin gets smoother and smoother and really makes such a difference. Accutane really affects people differently. I was lucky enough to not experience serious side effects . In my opinion; if you've tried everything else and nothing worked. Accuntane worked great for me and is a helpful drug.

I tried every acne treatment and my doc finally put me on accutane. It was a savior!! I definitely didn't get depression. If anything it made my life so much easier finishing out high school. I would've loved to have done an extra treament or a lazer treatment after just to take away the small scaring from acne on the balls of my checks. I still get break outs but not to the point that someone would say I have acne. I highly recommend accutane to someone with acne. It was the only thing that worked for me!

Not anything major however. sexual functions and urination were just fine.,The prescription was to take a tablet twice a day. I felt more comfortable taking it once  a day instead.

Effected not only myself; but my family. This was not me. Only took for three months. Took much longer for side effects to subside. In my opinion a dangerous drug. May not have the same effect on everyone; but these side effects seem to be common enough to be documented and taken seriously. At this point seem to be being ignored.,Took once daily until side effects became unbearable.

The anxiety and depression affected me almost immediately although I was completely clueless as to the cause. I cycled through every single anti-depressant and ADHD medication trying to solve this problem. It wasn't until I stopped the medication that I realized it was the Propecia. THESE SIDE EFFECTS HAVE NOT SUBSIDED AT ALL SEVEN MONTHS LATER! I would not wish this on my worst enemy. This drug has literally destroyed my life. I know that no one wants to lose their hair and look unattractive; but just imagine how attractive you will be if you are one of the unfortunate few of us that gets gynecomastia; penile fibrosis; and inability to ejaculate (I CANNOT EVEN MASTRUBATE TO ORGASM after taking this drug). If you value your life then I strongly suggest you find some other way!,1 pill per day

However; it did not do much for the hair I had already lost. I've been taking it for three years now and I have not seen any more receding; and my hair seems thicker than it used to be. ,They say that a major side effect could be impotence and a loss of sexual desire; but I did not experience either of those. Other than that; I can not really think of any other side effects I have experienced with Propecia over the last three years. ,I take one pill each day. Sometimes when my prescription runs out; I am forced to miss a few days; but I do not notice any changes as I think the medicine takes a longer time to work and stop working. I've worked it into my daily routine and although I do not like having to take a pill every day at 22 it has not been a problem.

The first month was okay; but after that I started having many emotional problems due to the hormone balance; I had difficulty receiving an erection; reaching orgasm; or being aroused in any way.  My relationship with my girlfriend suffered greatly. My testicles constantly ached and some days it was hard to concentrate on anything else because I was so uncomfortable.  After being off this medication for a few weeks now; I feel so much better.  Just a few days after I took my last pill I could tell a huge difference in the way I was feeling.  I would never take this medication again.  I believe this company should look at the side effects more and re-evaluate the statistics that they originally advertised.  It says that only about 1% of men experience any problems that I listed above...and it seems like I have read more negative reviews than positive.  ,1 mg/day

It didn't seem worth it to take the risk and try it; but I spoke to me Doctor about it. He advised me that if I noticed any of the symptoms; I should stop taking the medicine immediately. I took the chance because I don't want to look back ten (more like two; to be honest)years from now and say; "Man; I really wish I would have tried it. Maybe it would have worked; I should have at least done my best to fight this monster called baldness." So I tried it; and I knew almost within the second week that it wasn't for me. I notice all of the side effects and stop taking the medicine. I'm thankful for this website because it gives people the opportunity to be honest and share there experiences. If I had not read some of the comments; I might have continued with the medication and done more damage without knowing it. So thank you. I tried the drug; and realized it wasn't for me. I am very lucky that all of the symptoms have passed and I am back to normal. Funny thing though; here is something I realized; " I can't get laid without my hair; but if I take this drug; I can have hair but I still can't get laid." Who says the bug guy up there doesn't have a sense of humor? Good luck everyone.

Which has a clinical study reported to be successful. While it only has one ingredient which is thought to regrow hair; Saw palmetto ; it's clinical trial after 5 months saw over 80 percent of men regrow hair. It's a stimulant that appears to work; while the shampoo appears to thicken hair. I think it is working in conjunction with propecia to restore my hair.  ,-

The hairloss continued but worst of all the side-effects from this drug are severe and permanent.  This is very disturbing!,Sexual Dysfunction; depression; swelling; fatigue; redness and insomnia.  These side-effects were SEVERE and PERMANENT.  ,This drug should NOT be on the market!

After a couple of months I noticed that i had virtually no hair in my hands after washing it as opposed to 25-30 hairs before... also no more hair on my pillow; whereas before is was quite obvious it was falling out. Visually there is no more loss.  I don't know if it is growing back; but as long as it stays i'm cool...  ,I havent had any side effects that people have claimed; and erectile function is normal. Also; my sex drive was relatively low before; so i dont think that has changed.,one a day.... rarely miss a day...  like some people; I dont like taking a pill everyday; but...  but 2 dollars a day to keep your hair... definitely worth it!

To stop hair loss before it becomes noticable. I still have most of my hair and am using this drug as a preventative measure.,Slight loss of libido. Ejaculations are not as strong since starting drug. Less semen production. Sometimes slight pain during ejaculations.,I take Propecia once per day to stop hair loss at the crown. I've been on it for 3 months and have noticed much less hair falling out.
patient,36,male,hair loss,none,none,Propecia (Finasteride) ,topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,10,Highly Effective,No Side Effects,1mg  taken once a day for the period of have been for 5 years,My hair loss that I was experiencing stopped completely in it's tracks; and I actually grew back some hair at the crown of my head.  Every individual to whom I've recommended the drug has had at least their hair loss stop.  I'm a complete cynic and consider this a wonder drug. Once you start taking it (and if you continue to take it for the rest of your life- hey; that's science; man) you will keep all the hair you have from that moment on.,While they are forced to tell you that there is something like a 5% chance of becoming temporarily impotent; even for the people that effects the literature says that the majority of that small number get back their sex drive while continuing to take the drug. If you stop taking the drug it comes back immediately. I've not experienced any lessening of my libido; nor has anyone else that I've recommended the drug to.,You have to have a doctor's prescription; but to avoid the annoyance and price of a doctor's visit you can go to several websites that allow you to pay an extra fee; fill out a questionaire and then have a doctor who is on their payroll give you the prescription. That is okay because really if you're having hair loss and you know you are; why do you need a dermatolagist to tell you- "yeah; you're losing your hair"? It's an idiotic rule that makes this a controlled drug.  Anyway you take one pill a day- that's it; with or without meals.
patient,38,male,Male pattern baldness,Asthma.,None.,Propecia (Finasteride) ,topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,7,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,1 MG  taken once a day for the period of 4 weeks,Ostensibly this product will prevent further hair loss. While the initial male pattern baldness is mild; I fear worsening of the condition; and am taking this as a preventive measure.,I experienced sharp bursts of pain in the top rear left quadrant of my head intermittently for about seventy-two hours of commencing treatment. These subsided and may or may not be related to the medication.,I began taking the product to stave off the onset of male pattern baldness. As the treatment is said to show full effects in two years; my four-week course is probably not enough to show results. I will report again in due time.
patient,38,male,Male pattern baldness,Asthma.,None.,Propecia (Finasteride) ,topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,8,Moderately Effective,Mild Side Effects,1 MG  taken once a day for the period of 4 weeks,Ostensibly this will halt or even reverse the effects of male-pattern baldness. So far; one month in; there is not a great deal to report. I expected my hair loss to temporarily increase; as I had read in the literature that as dormant hair follicles reactivate; they push dead hairs out in order to form new ones. In other word; hair in a dead follicle will linger for a few months; and reactivation of the follicle will push out the old hair to make room for the new. So far; this has not occurred. The product must be taken for up to two years for any noticeable hair growth to take place; so I really haven't been on it long enough to judge its re-growth potential. In terms of halting the process; however; I must say there are fewer hairs in my brush each morning; so it's possible the drug is having an effect already. I will post a fuller report in another forty-seven months; I suppose.,I was surprised to experience brief blinding headaches in the upper left rear quadrant of my head; like a mini seconds-long burst of pressure that felt like a blunt object suddenly trying to explode out of my skull. This pressure would subside and I would go about my day. I'm told headaches are not one of the usual side-effects; so it may be an unrelated fluke. However; I've never had such an experience before; and it only manifested within about forty-eight hours of my first taking the drug and for seventy-two hours thereafter. The sudden and sporadic bursts of acute pain subsided; however; but I would caution anyone taking this drug for the first time to be on the lookout; especially if driving or in a public place with bright lights and a lot of noise around.,Overall; whether I am having some sort of placebo-effect reaction or not; my subjective impression is that hair loss has slowed or stopped and that the hair remaining appears fuller. I presented my symptoms to the doctor and she issued a prescription that same day; which I filled that afternoon at a local pharmacy and began taking immediately. The formulation I was prescribed was 1 milligram; although I believe the usual prescription is for 2 milligrams and can go as high as 5 milligrams. My case was mild to begin with; so it may be difficult to judge results. However; other than the mild side-effects I described above; which subsided within three days; I must say overall that my experience has been a positive one.

The front of my head was transplanted.  If you looked at me in the daylight; you would say that I had a "balding problem" and of course with the transplants I looked strange  After 6 months; it totally covered my crown and increased the texture of the remaining hair to a coarser density.  All of the fine hairs which were dormant came back with stronger and previous-strength follicles.  The transplanted hair on the top also became coarser.  Except in a very strong light looking directly down on the top of my head; now no one would say I was bald or even "thinning."  I am totally amazed with this product at age 55 and should have started taking it at 25.,None.  No change in sex drive.  Far less ejaculate than before however age 55 might have something to do with that.,1 mg per day and that was it.

Before beginning on this; my hairloss was rapidly escalating; both at the front and back; and this ceased and slightly reversed once started; and hasn't progressed since.,Definitely loss of libido; tiredness; some fogginess of thought; loss of muscle tone; occasional testicular pain; lowered blood pressure; increased floaters in vision; some gynecomastia when cycling down (minimised by taking Zinc on those days; but I would say not to discontinue this medication suddenly if taking a break or quitting).,Mostly generic Proscar - 5mg tablets cut into six equal pieces - 4 days on and one day off in a continuing cycle.

I've been using it for 6 to 7 months and I noticed hair regrowth within the second month.i did not do any research on the side effects and now that I think of it my eractions arn't what they use to be. I'm wondering if I stop using this drug if I will start balding again and the side effects will go away?

This product really does work,had a small decrease in libido; but it was nothing too serious.  If you like having sex 5 times a day; then this might not be for you.  But; you will still have a normal libido.  Also maybe some fatigue; but again could be related to something else.(stress),overall;this is great if you can't stand rogaine.

My barber of 15 years says my hair has not changed. I notice slight loss over the years; but I still have a lot of hair whereas I would most certainly be bald without it!,None,The cost is prohibitive for many. I took Propecia for many years (with great results) until I went to a new doctor and he offered to prescribe it's generic counterpart Finasteride. It costs about $30 for a six months supply compared to Propecia @ $85 for a one month supply. The only drawback is that the pill only comes in 5mg; so you have to cut it into 5 doses of 1mg. For that kind of savings it was no problem for me and it's been working for me for about 5 years! If your doctor won't do it; fire him/her as they are probably on the payroll of big pharma!

It didn't improve my hairline in the temples though.  ,Slight breast enlargement; I did not suffer from other side effects written in drug's leaflet. ,Treatment is very simple; I take one pill per day (in the morning).

Symptoms disappeared after stopping the drug. ,I took Propecia (Finasteride) for 5 years; and then stopped. I started taking the drug again recently because my hair loss greatly accelerated after stopping the initial treatment; however; the adverse symptoms returned immediately; and so I again stopped taking the drug.

Second; propecia does work even for a receding hairline; if u think your going to regrow your childhood hairline 99% of the time you won't. I have managed to keep my hair and regrow the thin parts and it just feels a lot better. and of course if you take a hormone blocking drug your gonna have sides but they are not bad at all i can still get a boner in about 10 seconds and its not limp. it didnt start really regrowing until about 6-7 months in so u gotta give it time.,not as bad as i was expecting; don't let some little drug mess with your mind man your bigger than that. if any i would say a lower libidio but i kind of like it because before propecia i was wanking off like 10 times a day and now its like once or every other day.,propecia is cool just do research; actually this shit is too expensive but if u care about your hair i would recommend it.

As if a fog had covered everything before mt eyes. i ignored it but till evening i started feeling as if i was drunk. i could not concentrate on anything. I felt  a bit of tiredness. I dint take the drug for next two days then i took 0.5 mg (1/2th of  1mg pill)on 3rd day and it proved to be the most horrible day of my life. It caused  extreme tiredness and mild pain in body as if i have got mild fever. I was totally exhausted and confused about what was happening. I felt the sensation in my blood vessels as if my blood pressure had risen and difficulty in breathing. I  was not able to think clearly and had no option than resting on my bed. i waited whole day to pass this nightmare.  In night i tried to  meditate to keep my mind peaceful. meditation helped me a bit but i found my rate was not normal . I went to sleep thinking every thing will be alright next day. in bed; I started feeling mild pain in my testicles. i surrendered my self to situation and waited for next morning meanwhile i got a sleep. Next morning i felt better as pain had disappeaed; tiredness was not there but still felt difficult to concentrate. But i could think clearly; I  carried the remaining pills of propecia with me on my waY to office and threw them in dustbin on road. I dont know why it happened but I never happened to me again as i never repeated this mistake of taking this drug.,I took it twice (2.5 and 0.5 mg on two separate days)

Very annoying. Slight loss of libido; erections affected very; very slightly (takes a small amount more time to achieve full).,Started years ago when I saw hair falling out slowly. Worked extremely well; but saw more negative reviews over the years and felt more sluggish (in my mind) over time. Decided its not worth it; and am off it cold turkey as of 4 days ago.

Regrew hair at the back of the scalp and on sides.  It doesn't appear that hair loss has ceased completely for MPB; but increased hair grow in another areas makes my head appear fuller,overall much happier having thicker hair than I would be with a consistent sex drive.  I am able to get more work done and focus more on important life goals than being constantly distracted with sex.  Instead of wanting sex 5 times per week; I only want it twice per month now.  Again; this is probably a plus,don't think Propecia is a cure-all for my particular pattern of baldness; but I feel it would be highly effective for others.  Anyone who is experiencing baldness at the back of scalp would benefit greatly.  The receding hairline will probably continue; but at a much slower pace.  I may eventually go completely bald regardless; but I honestly feel I've saved 3-5 years of youthful appearance.

I was prescribed Cetaphil lotion and lip balm to keep side effects at bay. Roaccutane was an excellent treatment.  Before going on it I spent hundreds of dollars on other anti-acne treatments such as Clearasil etc and had no joy.  Don't waste your money on other treatments just see your GP and ask for Roaccutane if you have an ongoing acne problem.

My skin was not by any means awful; but I did have evident pimples on my forehead and chin; and awful; awful blackheads on my nose that despite daily steaming and extraction; were terrible.  The drug totally cleared up my face; and my blackhead literally dried up in front of my eyes.  My once horribly oily skin changed to almost normal.,First; let me say that I didn't experience the awful side effects that some do with isotretinoin use.  I did turn very; very red around the perioral area and especially at the nasolabial folds.  My face felt as if I needed to peel it off and scratch deep down in the dermis.  In fact; that was my main complaint--the itchiness . . . and of course the dryness.  But the dryness was not nearly as bad as I expected.  For example; my lips never cracked.  However; I'm several years out from treatment ; and I still have dry skin problems.  It's weird because my skin was always so oily and now it's dry.  But that could be attributed to normal aging.  Regardless; I've become a real connosiour of facial moisturizers.  My skin is also a little more sensitive post isotretinoin.  Tazorac one percent; which I used to slather on nightly like lotion; now sets me on fire if I dare to use the half percent version more than twice a week.  I know the literature claims there's no anti-aging efficacy if it isn't used daily; but I'm hoping for the best.,I have to confess that I'm confused by this section.  There were no real "details" associated with my treatment aside from what I've alreay described.

Also to mention i was in a great deal of stress during this time because of college applications and school. The medicene worked for the time being but wore off.

So one benefit is that it gave him an alternative to antibiotics.,I got prescription insurance coverage and had to take a generic; which may have had even cheaper inactive ingredients.,fifteen years and several changes of dermatologists; I got a new doctor and asked if the metronidazole could be causing enlarged pores.

This is a very mild side effect and would not deter me from using this medication.  The results far outweighed the mild side effect.,My dermatologist prescribed clindamycin first for rosacea. I experienced moderate results from the clindamycin but not a significant improvement and still had significant breakouts from rosacea triggers. Metrogel rapidly reduced the overall redness of my skin and significantly reduced the breakouts in severity and duration.

Metrogel was prescribed by my family doctor.  At the time I had oily skin.  It was prescribed to be used 2 times a day.  I was also told to use Cetaphil cleanser.  My rosacea symptoms were redness; burning skin that felt hot to the touch.  I used the Metrogel religiously as prescribed.  For the first 2 weeks; it burned on contact.  I hated it.  After awhile my skin started calming down and I stopped using the Metrogel.  Everytime my skin flared up I would use it again.  I'm using it right now.  I can't really say if the Metrogel helped at all.  Sometimes I think it is very irritating but I'm told to use it when necessary. Redness is sometimes better after use; but I don't know if it the result of the Metrogel.  I would like to find something better out there.

Apparently my dermatologist had used this treatment on a number of patients and had received a good success rate.  I did not see any benefits over the time I used the product (3 months) but was advised that I needed to continue treatment.,There were no noticeable side effects that I was aware of.  The product is an ointment with a rather oily feel and needs to be left on the effected areas for some period of time so I applied it at night.  I did not find that it had any effect in any positive or negative way over the period I applied it.  ,I was asked by the prescribing doctor to apply the ointment once a day to the affected areas (the back of both of my hands).  This was the entire process and I was to report back to him within a period of approximately six months.  This was a rather experimental treatment.  I applied the product as instructed but did not notice any repigmentation during the time I applied it (around 3 months).  I subsequently was advised by the doctor that I needed to continue the application; for a total period of at least six months

I have used this for years without realizing its side effects or being told about the side effects from my doctors or pharmacist. ,This drug has severe side effects; and I was not told about ANY of them! I believe I have gotten shingles as a side effect from this drug. Shingles tends to happen to the elderly or people with weakened immune systems. My immune system was weakened by this drug enough to get shingles!  Do your research before continuing to choose to use this product. ,educate yourself and try many other alternatives before even considering using this product. I have used it for many years and regret it after learning about all the harmful side effects.

It helps to take a break while using it because your skin will become used to it; however after a few weeks off; the effects are just as wondederful to your skin as when you first began.,Peeling; dryness; sun sensitivity,I applied a small amount of Retin-A every evening before bed and washed if off in the morning.  If you are able to get through the initial stage which includes the side effects  (peeling; dry skin; redness; irritation; and sun sensitivity) your skin will emerge better looking and healthier in the end.

The fine lines especially around my eyes and cheeks diminished and were not as deep. My entire skin tone looked younger; more even toned and my large pores were much less noticeable and more refined. My skin looked much healthier and it looked more soft focus. It took a few months to notice a measurable difference.,The main side effects I had while using Retin-A were drier;flaky skin.,When I started using Retin-A I started with the lower strength prescription to aviod side effects while my skin was acclimating to Retin-A. I started with Retin-A .025% strength every other night. After cleansing I wait 20 to 30 minutes and then apply the Retin-A. After another 30 minutes I apply a moisturizer if needed over the Retin-A. After about 2 months I switched to the next higher strength Retin-A which is .05%. I was much more senstive to this strength so I started using it once every 3 nights to start doing the same as above; waiting 20 to 30 minutes after cleansing to apply. Once my skin tolerated this routine after about a month without flakiness I went to every other night. I now can use Retin-A .05% every night but occasionally when I start to see any dryness or skin flaking I will skip a night to give my skin a rest. I love my results. Retin-A is the only skin care I've used where I have noticed a considerable difference in the amount of sun damage that has been repaired. My skin is much more healthy looking and more refined.

The color really improved as well - much less blotchy and more "dewy." ,Very dry skin. A lot of peeling.,After washing my face with a gentle cleanser; I would wait 20 minutes and then put on the cream. I would then wait another 20 minutes and put some lotion on because the tretnoin was just too drying.

My mom and I have the same type of skin - we both have some degree of acne as adults.  In the 90's my Mom started using Retin-A to control this and apparently it worked well; so I tried it (her prescription) as a teenager and it just irritated my face ; making it red and eventually flaky.  The drug is certainly powerful.  I am sure I would have benefited from continued use but I didn't.  Now; approaching 30; I still have some acne and am starting to think any acne whatsoever is unacceptable.  Reviewing options; Retin-A seems top on the list.  I have read that retinol is a distant second.  However; I am hesitant because of the inevitable initial irritation and flakyness associated with Retin-A. ,see above ,see above

Once the intitial effects were seen; they seemed to level out.  I used the cream nightly as I did not wear it during the day.  My skin felt smooth and soft after the first week.,Some redness did occur at first.  After the the first week; the redness disappeared.  There was some sensitivity; but that too went a way.  Other than that; I did not have any other side effects.,I went to doctor to find out how to improve skin condition and rejuvenate skin from sun damage.  After a long questionaire and exam; she prescribed retin-A.

Used in combination with Erthyrom. caplets (and also topical; used occasionally); I have been able to control deep acne cysts. While the Erthyrom. is probably the major factor; the Retin-A is a good addition.,Peeling which can chafe the skin and interfer with putting on face makeup. However; I have built up such a tolerance; I would have to apply Retin-A 2-3 times daily to achieve major peeling. It is hard to measure the anti-aging effect; as I don't know what I would look like without having used Retin-A. ,I use once at night. Because I have built up a tolerance; I have no adverse side effects. If I do have occasional peeling; I remove/stimulate it with a Buff Puff.

My skin seemed to appear brighter and my complexion was not as splotchy. While I did not get any more whiteheads; it did not completely remove the ones I had.,The worst side effect was the burning sensation I experienced during the first few weeks. The area that was affected was around my mouth. I started to put less in that area and the burning cessation decreased. I had some minor flaking; but not a lot. ,I put the cream on every night for 8 months. My dermatologist told me that the Retin A should help to unclog my pores. By continuing the Retina A I just sgould not have any new whitheads form.

It reduced some fine wrinkles and helped with uneven skin.,The side effects experienced were mainly red irritation and peeling. There was also an occasional bout of acne breakouts. The use also led to a couple of times when the skin felt like it had been burnt or had a sever sunburn.,Treatment was for sun damage to the skin. The retin-a was applied daily in the evening. It was advised not to use it durig the day since it could lead to excessive exposure of the sun.

Increased sensitivity to UV light; necessitating daily use of high PPD sunscreen. ,I started applying a pea-sized amount of the Retin-A cream on every second night about one hour after washing. After two weeks; because there were no adverse effects for me I started using the cream nightly. With nightly usage I experienced very slight side-effects of sensitivity; slight redness after washing and occasional slight flaking. None of these effects were severe so I continued with nightly treatment. After approximately one month I experienced gradual lessening in severity and frequency of comedonic acne. Comedones still formed; but were less likely to become inflamed/infected. Slight reduction in surface oiliness noted. After about 10 weeks I noted a slight improvement in sundamage and skin texture. Overall I was very pleased with the efficacy of this product; but may in the future switch to the Retin-A gel to see if this results in a further reduction of comedones.

I started in the end of November and by mid February my face was extremely clear. I stop using it after my face cleared up; WRONG THING TO DO. Once your face has cleared you still need to continue using it so your face can remain clear.,I got a whole lot of bumps on my face from using heavy amount of retin-a on my face. You only need to use a little to get the job done. It's very strong and needs to be put on very lightly on the bumps. Excessive retin-a will cause you to look worse!,I love rein-a only because it grabs everything from underneath the surface and brings it out. It really works but takes time and patience. I would always stick to retin-a and never change because it gets the job done and theres no turning back.

Lessening of fine lines. More even and radiant skin tone,Slight peeling and redness when treatment began,I began taking Retin-A because my skin was having breakouts at a very frequent rate. I began by washing my face with a mild ceanser. I alternated between Dove senstive skin and Cetaphil. The face must be washed gently with NO manipulation; scrubbing or washcloth!! After this I rinse with warm water to make sure all soap residue is gone. I then LIGHTLY pat my face dry with the softest towel I can find. Let the face AIR DRY for 15 minutes; then a PEA size amount of Retin-A can be applied to the face. This little amount is for the WHOLE face. Once the whole face is covered with the Retin-A ; let it sink in for 5 minutes; then apply a moisturizer. I like to use Cetaphil cream for this or Moisturel. Remember that Retin-A should ONLY be used at NIGHT!! You must wear an SPF 30 sunscreen during the day as it makes the skin sensitive.

Being in my 40's; I saw a benefit in my skin tone also.,The cream is very drying; despite putting a moisturizer on after it.  In the winter; I sometimes cannot use it on a daily basis since my skin will peel.  In addition; I have to make sure the cream goes no where near my eye area; since my eyes will tear the next day if the cream gets within 1 inch from my eye.  The cream makes a person more sun sensitive also; however; I always wear a 45 sunscreen.  I cannot use on my neck since I got a rash every time I tried.  The side effects are far less than any of the oral medications my dermatologist tried with me.,After washing my face and allowing it to dry; I apply the Retin-A in small amounts over my cheeks; nose; chin; and forehead.  I use it every night; except when my skin is peeling too much from use.  Then I either switch to every other night; or put a moisturizer on first (incidentally; my dermatologist said the Retin-A should be put on first; under the moisturizer).  I rarely ever get pimples in the areas I use the product.  Even though there are some side effects; the benefits outweigh that.

The recommended amount was "pea sized" but I found it too thick to get this amount to massage into the whole face.

I found it especially good at spot treatment if I felt a cystic type coming up.,It did dry my skin out and there was peeling in some places; like the sides of my nose.  I had to be very careful about not getting it any where around my lips; because if I did I would quickly get a fever blister on my mouth. I don't know why this happened; but it was bothersome. ,I applied it after cleansing skin at night and made sure my skin was completely dry before I put any on and I used a small amount; which was sometimes hard to spread around.

There are less clogged pores and it definitely more smooth and even in skin tone.  Any fine lines around my mouth and on my forehead have diminished but it hasn't helped much with fine lines around my eyes. ,It does cause the skin to flake and peel but this can be counteracted with a good moisturizer.  Also; my face gets red or flushed easily with the slightest irritant.  Lastly; not being able to stay in the sun is a downfall. ,I use Retin-A 0.25% every evening along with 70 mg of Accutane a day.

Initially; I experienced and increase in the presence of acne pimples and moderate redness and irritation. This lasted for a couple of weeks as my skin adjusted to the medication. Within about six weeks; I would guess my skin was 75% clearer. Over the past twelve years; I have experienced only rare pimples which resolved quickly with little or no discoloration. One important note: do not scrub the face with washcloths or any other abrasive products; and use plenty of moisturizer. Scrubbing makes the irritation and pimples worse.,Redness and mild to moderate irritation initially. Photosensitivity (use a moisturizer with a high spf sunscreen). Seasonal changes can increase dryness.,Cleanse face with a mild soap each night. While skin is still wet; apply Retin A (pea sized amount will cover entire face). Allow to air dry completely.

If this occurred; I would stop using it for a day or two; and the problem would go away.  It was more of a concern in the winter months when my skin was more dry.

I believe the product does actually promote quick cell turnover based on the results I have seen thust far.,I have been fortunate to have only experienced minimal irritation.  Initially; I had tightness; dry feeling on my face; with some peeling or shedding.  This subsequently caused some itching; but; again; no irritation or pain.  I noticed when applied to active blemishes; the blemish seemed to worsen; become redder;and seemed like it wouldn't heal; but I have combated that by adding a good; natural moisturizer into my routine after the application.,I started using .05 % retina-a every evening after cleansing; but making sure my face was completely dry.  Only a small amount of the cream was needed.  I applied it carefully; avoiding lips and inner eye area.  Afterwards; I used a non-greasy; non-comedogenic moisturizer to minimize dryness; flaking and irritation.

I had mild/moderate acne; and Retin-A did decrease the amount of ance I had.  I liked Retin-A also because it reduces wrinkles.  I am only 28; so I don't have many wrinkles; but used it as prevention.,My skin would become too dry.  It seemed that even after months of usage; my ance would not completely disappear.  If I used more Retin-A; my acne would get better for a week or two until my skin became too dry and then I would have worse acne,I would apply Retin-A to my face once a day at night

I still get a pimple here and there; but for the most part; my skin has been very clear.,My skin had slight burning the next day as well as a lot of flaking and dryness.  It is very difficult to control the dryness.  I put a lot of moisturizer on it in the morning; but need to reapply it throughout the day.,After wasing your face at night and letting it completely dry; you apply a thin layer all over your face and go to bed.  In the morning you need to wash your face and apply a lot of moisturizer.  Stick with it; it will provide resluts after about 6 weeks.

It particularly helped the kind of lines that radiate from the corner of my eyes down my cheeks.  They virtually disappeared; and people remarked within a few months that I looked healthier; less tired; and younger.  I was happy with the results of using this product.   ,Irritated skin; dry skin. When I first started using this product; they gave me a weaker strength and I gradually was given stronger formulas as my skin got used to it.  The only problem was that if I used a little too much; even later as my skin was used to the formula; I would wake up with red skin that looked like a sunburn.  I eventually moved to using topical ascorbic acid instead of Retin-A; which works well and doesn't cause the skin irritation.   ,I spread a dab or two of the cream on my face at night before sleeping.  It took several weeks to acclimate to the cream. It did improve the appearance of my skin. I noticed that it also made what the dermatologist called pre-cancerous spots disappear (these were a couple of small spots that the doctor wanted to treat with topical vitamin A).

This was really the best product I ever used. Common over the counter products and benzoyl didn't work; which was very frustrating. However; the effects are only temporary. As soon as I stop using it; after a few days I will get blackheads again.,I really did experience redness and flaking; like most users did. But that was mainly around the soft tissues; such as my mouth. So I decided to use it more on the trouble areas and less on the other parts. Side effects were reduced after combining with Jojoba Oil.,I applied a pea size every day. You really do have to wait 20 minutes after washing your face before applying; because otherwise you will really have an increase of the side effects. Then wait a bit longer to let it absorb and use a moisturizer which is non comedogenic; like jojoba oil. Worked fine for me! And I have very sensitve skin.

Aside from acne; it seemed to help my skin in general.  This is by far the best acne treatment I've used.  Now I use it for overall skin appearance (not just for acne).,Thinning of skin leaves more sun sensitivity. Also; it cleared my acne; but didn't seem to "treat" it - if I stop using it; my acne comes back within a few weeks.,Very easy - simply applied a pea-sized amount every other night before bed.

I would use it; the skin would peel and the lines are slightly reduced. It also dries up blemishes,peeling; dryness; slight irritation. There weren't any serious side effects.  the packaging warns about sun exposure but I stay away from the sun so I did not have a reaction from the sun while using product.,I used this cream a few times a week at first and now I use it only occasionally. It is a moderately thick white cream that I applied only to target areas; frown lines; forehead; etc. Also applied to breakouts. The skin would peel slightly after a day or two and then new skin is revealed underneath. This is a very easy way to treat very fine lines.

I kept with the treatment for maybe 1-2 months; and then could no longer tolerate the appearance and feel of my skin. It seemed like I was more self-conscious of the side effects than I had been of the acne and breakouts (which were still present anyway).

Caused sensitivity when using other products....night creme; serums and sunscreen. I have read that these side affects are normal and part of the skin adjusting to the retin a.....after all that is what it is supposed to do...create a chemical change in the cell which promotes cellular turnover resulting in newer; firmer skin.,Daily apply about a pea size amount of the creme on my hand and sparingly apply to the orbital area; lips and forehead. I add additional creme to the back of my hands and rub vigourously ( rubbing the back of my hands together). I also apply a dime size to my neck and decollete area also rubbing; but not as vigourously. I generally do this every night after I cleanse; tone and add serums ( for pigment relief and building collegen) if I am feeling especially dry after applying the Tretinoina;I will also add a moisturizer.

With the combination of the Obagi skin care; my skin also became uniform in color overall and the darker or brown spots faded which helps to make my skin look even better.  I don't have much wrinkles to speak of except minimal ones around the eye area and laugh lines around the mouth which I did not notice any change or improvement on that.

Also; the skin tone feels tighter and my pores appear smaller. I have; at times; gone off of the cream for a few weeks at a time; particularly during the summmer when the Florida sun is at its most intense. ,Initially; the skin has to get used to the treatment.  I experienced redness and moderate flaking in the first 2 weeks (at different intervals). However; the skin eventually becomes tolerant of the product.  There is still the periodic sloughing of dead skin cells; but that's okay because you'll have a fresh; healthy glow afterwards. ,Retin A is a simple topical application to use.  I use it sparingly; minimum every other day; on my face and neck. I plan to continue using this product as part of my anti-aging regimine.

I was also really happy with the evening of pigmentation. I had sun and age spots as well as freckling and  saw a huge difference in the lightening of all these problems.  My skin had a much better over all tone a seemed to become firmer over time.,The first few weeks of treatment my skin was peeling a little and I had some red splotches but eventually these symptoms went away.  ,I would wash my face in the evening with a mild cleanser and then every other night when my face was completely dry I would apply a small amount of Retin-A to my face with the exception of the immediate eye area. The evenings that I did not use Retin-A I would use a good night moisturizer.
patient,60,female,sun damage to face,rosacea in nose area,Stri-Vectin,Retin-A Micro (Tretinoin Topical) ,topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes topical-agents-skin-and-mucous-membranes,10,Highly Effective,Moderate Side Effects,0.1%  (dosage frequency: every other night)  for the period of 1 year +,The prescription recommended that I use the gel every night; but this became too drying on my skin.  I alternate one night of Retin-A; 1 night of Stri-Vectin.  The Retin-A causes my face to peel; so exfoliating frequently is necessary so that I don't look as if my face has dandruff.  I use a Clarisonic for cleansing; it has been wonderful.  I have also used Benefit's "Bluff Dust" to cover the redness that the Retin-A gel causes; and continue to use Noritate for my rosacea.  The Retin-A is very effective; but also quite expensive.  I have found a pharmacy in Canada where I can order it online for less than 50% the US price.  I hope this doesn't make me sound unpatriotic!  I have always taken good care of my skin; and have no big wrinkles or droops --except for those lines between my eyebrows; because I am a committed scowler.  I do not believe that Retin-A would be as effective on skin that has already developed a good deal of sagging; but this is my personal opinion and is based only on my own experience.,exfoliated and moisturized; my skin looks wonderful.  I have used Benefit Cosmetics' "Bluff Puff" to tone down the redness; I have stopped using any kind of makeup base if my face is shedding because foundation doesn't tolerate pieces of peeling skin very well.  However; my complexion looks great without makeup.  I still use mascara and liner and shadow.,following night I wash my face and when it is clean and dry; I apply Stri-Vectin.  I alternate so that one night I use Retin-A and the next night I use Stri-Vectin or another moisturizer.  I don't think I will be buying any more Stri-Vectin because I am doubtful of its effectiveness and because I would prefer to make my own product.  I know that I will be unable to make Retin-A gel; but making other products for my own use is very attractive to me.

I had many pimples around my mouth after getting waxied there and nothing was helping.  Further as soon as one pimple went away another formed.  This cream began to work within several days.  I could tell that the pimples were getting lighter and new pimples that were forming would hardly enlarge because I applied the cream as soon as I saw a new one forming; many of them disappeared without even leaving a blemish affterwards.,I had no side effects because I was applying the cream correctly; only before bedtime and washed them off in the morning.  However I heard of some other person whp took the same cream but was not aware of those instruction and instead applied it in the morning and  had her face exposed during the day.  The cream worked somewhat for her but the spots where she applied them stayed irritated and would turn red when the wind blew in her face.  This condition remained for several years afterwards for her.  THIS CREAM CANNOT BE EXPOSED TO THE SUN! Otherwise it works beautifully.,The treatment was very simple.  At night (and only at night!) I cleaned my face with a mild cleanser or atleast with water and did not apply any other medication before hand.  Afterwards I simply dabbed a very small; thin layer of the cream over the pimple and allowed the cream to dry and then went to sleep.  In the morning I made sure to wash off the cream before going outside.  For very sensitive skin the area may turn red but this is temporary and simply means that instead of applying each day one must use it every other day.

I had been on HRT for 10 years  so that should be factored in to the equation.,The humidity in Florida helped so much in building up tolerance for the drying effect of Retin-A. I had to be extremely careful NOT to introduce any other strong product AHA or Gylgolic Acid and washing once daily with mild cleanser (Cetaphil). Once Retin-A Micro was introduced to the public I switched and I literally can smear it everywhere around my nose and lips and close to my eyes with no problem. However I do not use Retin A in cold dry climates or on vacations because of the changes in atmosphere and environment.,that skin is completely dry.

Although the peeling wasn't as bad as with regular Retin-A; the redness and flaking skin affected my appearance.

Pores on my cheeks are noticeably smaller. Acne scars faded. Skin looks more polished.,A few days a week; my face would be red; very sensitive; and peeling. Then it would be back to normal and then a few days later the peeling starts again.,I use this drug to help with the overall appearance of my skin; especially blackheads; pore size; and acne scars. I don't have any wrinkles; so I can't comment on how well it worked for that. But hopefully it is preventing wrinkles from ever developing. I only use it twice a week now coz my skin is very sensitive. Once I get more used to the drug; I will slowly increase the frequency. During the first two weeks of use; I didn't really notice any changes except that my skin was drier and started to peel a little. By the third week; I started seeing my blackheads disappearing and my pores changing. They actually looked bigger. Then after 2 months of continued usage; my pores got smaller; acne scars faded and blackheads are almost completely gone. Few days a week I would have red; irritated peeling skin. But nothing extremley terrible or intolerable. With good moisturizer and calming face creams; I'm able to minimize my peeling to a point where it doesn't bother me that much. I've heard that Retin-A takes awhile to work and see results; but I've already seen positive changes in less than 6 months. I can't wait to find out the long-term benefits it will have on my skin; especially after I start increasing the frequency and concentration.
